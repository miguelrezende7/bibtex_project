abstract = {Since a low-quality data may influence the effectiveness and reliability of applications, data quality is required to be guaranteed. Data quality assessment is considered as the foundation of the promotion of data quality, so it is essential to access the data quality before any other data related activities. In the electric power industry, more and more electric power data is continuously accumulated, and many electric power applications have been developed based on these data. In China, the power grid has many special characteristic, traditional big data assessment frameworks cannot be directly applied. Therefore, a big data framework for electric power data quality assessment is proposed. Based on big data techniques, the framework can accumulate both the real-time data and the history data, provide an integrated computation environment for electric power big data assessment, and support the storage of different types of data.},

abstract = {In the Big Data Era, data is the core for any governmental, institutional, and private organization. Efforts were geared towards extracting highly valuable insights that cannot happen if data is of poor quality. Therefore, data quality (DQ) is considered as a key element in Big data processing phase. In this stage, low quality data is not penetrated to the Big Data value chain. This paper, addresses the data quality rules discovery (DQR) after the evaluation of quality and prior to Big Data pre-processing. We propose a DQR discovery model to enhance and accurately target the pre-processing activities based on quality requirements. We defined, a set of pre-processing activities associated with data quality dimensions (DQD's) to automatize the DQR generation process. Rules optimization are applied on validated rules to avoid multi-passes pre-processing activities and eliminates duplicate rules. Conducted experiments showed an increased quality scores after applying the discovered and optimized DQR's on data.},

abstract = {Data Profiling and data quality management become a more significant part of data engineering, which an essential part of ensuring that the system delivers quality information to users. In the last decade, data quality was considered to need more managing. Especially in the big data era that the data comes from many sources, many data types, and an enormous amount. Thus it makes the managing of data quality is more difficult and complicated. The traditional system was unable to respond as needed. The data quality managing software for big data was developed but often found in a high-priced, difficult to customize as needed, and mostly provide as GUI, which is challenging to integrate with other systems. From this problem, we have developed an opensource package for data quality managing. By using Python programming language, Which is a programming language that is widely used in the scientific and engineering field today. Because it is a programming language that is easy to read syntax, small, and has many additional packages to integrate. The software developed here is called “Sakdas” this package has been divided into three parts. The first part deals with data profiling provide a set of data analyses to generate a data profile, and this profile will help to define the data quality rules. The second part deals with data quality auditing that users can set their own data quality rules for data quality measurement. The final part deals with data visualizing that provides data profiling and data auditing report to improve the data quality. The results of the profiling and auditing services, the user can specify both the form of a report for self-review. Or in the form of JSON for use in post-process automation.},

abstract = {Big Data has gained an enormous momentum the past few years because of the tremendous volume of generated and processed Data from diverse application domains. Nowadays, it is estimated that 80% of all the generated data is unstructured. Evaluating the quality of Big data has been identified to be essential to guarantee data quality dimensions including for example completeness, and accuracy. Current initiatives for unstructured data quality evaluation are still under investigations. In this paper, we propose a quality evaluation model to handle quality of Unstructured Big Data (UBD). The later captures and discover first key properties of unstructured big data and its characteristics, provides some comprehensive mechanisms to sample, profile the UBD dataset and extract features and characteristics from heterogeneous data types in different formats. A Data Quality repository manage relationships between Data quality dimensions, quality Metrics, features extraction methods, mining methodologies, data types and data domains. An analysis of the samples provides a data profile of UBD. This profile is extended to a quality profile that contains the quality mapping with selected features for quality assessment. We developed an UBD quality assessment model that handles all the processes from the UBD profiling exploration to the Quality report. The model provides an initial blueprint for quality estimation of unstructured Big data. It also, states a set of quality characteristics and indicators that can be used to outline an initial data quality schema of UBD.},

abstract = {A USAF sponsored MITRE research team undertook four separate, domain-specific case studies about Big Data applications. Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the "truth about Big Data" is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects. Some DQ issues exhibit return-s-to-scale effects, and become more or less pronounced in Big Data analytics, though. Big Data Quality varies from one type of Big Data to another and from one Big Data technology to another.},

abstract = {Big data has been transformed into knowledge by information systems to add value in businesses. Enterprises relying on it benefit from risk management to a certain extent. The value, however, depends on the quality of data. The quality needs to be verified before any use of the data. Specifically, measuring the quality by simulating the real life situation and even forecast it accurately turns into a hot topic. In recent years, there have been numerous researches on the measurement and assessment of data quality. These are yet to utilize a scientific computational method for the measurement and prediction. Current methods either fail to make an accurate prediction or do not consider the correlation and time sequence factors of the data. To address this, we design a model to extend machine learning technique to business applications predicting this. Firstly, we implement the model to detect data noises from a risk dataset according to an international data quality standard from banking industry and then estimate their impacts with Gaussian and Bayesian methods. Secondly, we direct sequential learning in multiple deep neural networks for the prediction with an attention mechanism. The model is experimented with various network methodologies to show the predictive power of machine learning technique and is evaluated by validation data to confirm the model effectiveness. The model is scalable to apply to any industries utilizing big data other than the banking industry.},

abstract = {Data is the most valuable asset companies are proud of. When its quality degrades, the consequences are unpredictable, can lead to complete wrong insights. In Big Data context, evaluating the data quality is challenging, must be done prior to any Big data analytics by providing some data quality confidence. Given the huge data size, its fast generation, it requires mechanisms, strategies to evaluate, assess data quality in a fast, efficient way. However, checking the Quality of Big Data is a very costly process if it is applied on the entire data. In this paper, we propose an efficient data quality evaluation scheme by applying sampling strategies on Big data sets. The Sampling will reduce the data size to a representative population samples for fast quality evaluation. The evaluation targeted some data quality dimensions like completeness, consistency. The experimentations have been conducted on Sleep disorder's data set by applying Big data bootstrap sampling techniques. The results showed that the mean quality score of samples is representative for the original data, illustrate the importance of sampling to reduce computing costs when Big data quality evaluation is concerned. We applied the Quality results generated as quality proposals on the original data to increase its quality.},

abstract = {Big Data has become an imminent part of all industries and business sectors today. All organizations in any sector like energy, banking, retail, hardware, networking, etc all generate huge quantum of heterogenous data which if mined, processed and analyzed accurately can reveal immensely useful patterns for business heads to apply to generate and grow their businesses. Big Data helps in acquiring, processing and analyzing large amounts of heterogeneous data to derive valuable results. Quality of information is affected by size, speed and format in which data is generated. Hence, Quality of Big Data is of great relevance and importance. We propose addressing various aspects of the raw data to improve its quality in the pre-processing stage, as the raw data may not usable as-is. We are exploring process like Cleansing to fix as much data as feasible, Noise filters to remove bad data, as well sub-processes for Integration and Filtering along with Data Transformation/Normalization. We evaluate and profile the Big Data during acquisition stage, which is adapted to expectations to avoid cost overheads later while also improving and leading to accurate data analysis. Hence, it is imperative to improve Data quality even it is absorbed and utilized in an industry's Big Data system. In this paper, we propose a Pre-Processing Framework to address quality of data in a weather monitoring and forecasting application that also takes into account global warming parameters and raises alerts/notifications to warn users and scientists in advance.},

This will help to understand how data quality from big data analysis can be improved. For this, a literature review was performed and data was collected using three case studies, followed by content analysis. The overall findings indicate that there are no fundamentally new data quality issues in big data projects. Nevertheless, the complexity of the issues is higher, which makes it harder to assess and attain data quality in big data projects compared to the traditional projects. Ten antecedents of big data quality were identified encompassing data, technology, people, process and procedure, organization, and external aspects.},

However, there is a lack of frameworks or guidelines about how to carry out those big data quality initiatives. The starting point of any data quality work is to determine the properties of data quality, termed as data quality dimensions (DQDs). Even those dimensions lack precise rigour in terms of definition from existing literature. This current research aims to contribute towards identifying the most important DQDs for big data in the health industry. It is a continuation of a previous work, which already identified five most important DQDs, using a human judgement based technique known as inner hermeneutic cycle. To remove potential bias coming from the human judgement aspect, this research uses the same set of literature but applies a statistical technique known to extract knowledge from a set of documents known as latent semantic analysis. The results confirm only 2 similar most important DQDs, namely accuracy and completeness.},

abstract = {Currently, a large amount of data is amassed in electronic health records (EHRs). However, EHR systems are largely information silos, that is, uses of these systems are often confined to management of patient information and analytics specific to a clinician's practice. A growing trend in healthcare is combining multiple databases to support epidemiological research. The College Health Surveillance Network is the first national data warehouse containing EHR data from 31 different student health centers. Each member university contributes to the data warehouse by uploading select EHR data including patient demographics, diagnoses, and procedures to a common server on a monthly basis. In this paper, we focus on the data quality dimensions from a subsample of the data comprised of over 5.7 million patient visits for approximately 980,000 patients with 4,465 unique diagnoses from 23 of those universities. We examine the data for measures of completeness, consistency, and availability for secondary use for epidemiological research. Additionally, clinical documentation practices and EHR vendor were evaluated as potential contributors to data quality. We found that overall about 70% of the data in the data warehouse is available for secondary use, and identified clinical documentation practices that are correlated to a reduction in data quality. This suggests that automated quality control and proactive clinical documentation support could reduce ad-hoc data cleaning needs resulting in greater data availability for secondary use.},

The task of maintaining the quality of data, however, is non-trivial and poses a challenge for a program like the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) that collects data from hundreds of instruments across the world, and distributes thousands of streaming data products that are continuously produced in near-real-time for an archive 1.7 Petabyte in size and growing. In this paper, we present a computational data processing workflow to address the data quality issues via an easy and intuitive web-based portal that allows reporting of any quality issues for any site, facility or instruments at a granularity down to individual variables in the data files. This portal allows instrument specialists and scientists to provide corrective actions in the form of symbolic equations. A parallel processing framework applies the data improvement to a large volume of data in an efficient, parallel environment, while optimizing data transfer and file I/O operations; corrected files are then systematically versioned and archived. A provenance tracking module tracks and records any change made to the data during its entire life cycle which are communicated transparently to the scientific users. Developed in Python using open source technologies, this software architecture enables fast and efficient management and improvement of data in an operational data center environment.},

Applying them to automate and optimize earth observation data management is a hot topic. To improve data quality control mechanisms, a machine learning method in combination with built-in quality rules is presented in this paper to evolve processes around data quality and enhance management of earth observation data. The rules of quality check are set up to detect the common issues, including data completeness, data latency, bad data, and data duplication, and the machine learning model is trained, tested, and deployed to address these quality issues automatically and reduce manual efforts.},

abstract = {Currently, as a result of the continuous increase of data, one of the key issues is the development of systems and applications to deal with storage, management and processing of big numbers of data. These data are found in unstructured ways. Data management with traditional approaches is inappropriate because of the large and complex data sizes. Hadoop is a suitable solution for the continuous increase in data sizes. The important characteristics of the Hadoop are distributed processing, high storage space, and easy administration. Hadoop is better known for distributed file systems. In this paper, we have proposed techniques and algorithms that deal with big data including data collecting, data preprocessing, algorithms for data cleaning, A Technique for Converting Unstructured Data to Structured Data using metadata, distributed data file system (fragmentation algorithm) and Quality assurance algorithms by using the model is the statistical model to evaluate the highest educational institutions. We concluded that Metadata accelerates query response required and facilitates query execution, metadata will be content for reports, fields and descriptions. Total time access for three complex queries in distributed processing it is 00: 03: 00 per second while in nondistributed processing it is at 00: 15: 77 per second, average is approximately five minutes per second. Quality assurance note values (T-test) is 0.239 and values (T-dis) is 1.96, as a result of dealing with scientific sets and humanities sets. In the comparison law, it can be deduced that if the t-test is smaller than the t-dis; so there is no difference between the mean of the scientific and humanities samples, the values of C.V for both scientific is (8.585) and humanities sets is (7.427), using the law of homogeneity know whether any sets are more homogeneous whenever the value of a small C.V was more homogeneous however the humanity set is more homogeneity.},

While we are leveraging this data for analyzing complex systems using machine learning and deep learning, a considerable amount of time and effort is spent on addressing data quality issues. If undetected, data quality issues can cause large deviations in the analysis, misleading data scientists. To ease the effort of identifying and addressing data quality challenges, we introduce DQA, a scalable, automated and interactive data quality advisor. In this paper, we describe the DQA framework, provide detailed description of its components and the benefits of integrating it in a data science process. We propose a programmatic approach for implementing the data quality framework which automatically generates dynamic executable graphs for performing data validations fine-tuned for a given dataset. We discuss the use of DQA to build a library of validation checks common to many applications. We provide insight into how DQA addresses many persistence and usability issues which currently make data cleaning a laborious task for data scientists. Finally, we provide a case study of how DQA is implemented in a realworld system and describe the benefits realized.},

However, the advent of Big Data might pose some serious questions pertaining to the applicability of existing data quality concepts. There is a debate concerning the importance of data quality for Big Data; one school of thought argues that high data quality methods are essential for deriving higher level analytics while another school of thought argues that data quality level will not be so important as the volume of Big Data would be used to produce patterns and some amount of dirty data will not mask the analytic results which might be derived. This paper aims to investigate various components and activities forming part of data quality management such as dimensions, metrics, data quality rules, data profiling and data cleansing.

Poor data quality can be costly, lead to breaks in processes and invalidate the company's efforts on regulatory compliance. In order to process data streams in real time, a new technology called CEP (complex event processing) was developed. In France, the current deployment of smart meters will generate massive electricity consumption data. In this work, we developed a diagnostic approach to compute generic quality indicators of smart meter data streams on the fly. This solution is based on Tibco StreamBase CEP. Visualization tools were also developed in order to give a better understanding of the inter-relation between quality issues and geographical/temporal dimensions. According to the application purpose, two visualization methods can be loaded: (1) StreamBase LiveView is used to visualize quality indicators in real time; and (2) a Web application provides a posteriori and geographical analysis of the quality indicators which are plotted on a map within a color scale (lighter colors indicate good quality and darker colors indicate poor quality). In future works, new quality indicators could be added to the solution which can be applied in an operational context in order to monitor data quality from smart meters.},

abstract = {As the demand for smart grid construction increases, advanced power applications based on edge-cloud collaboration continue to increase. Among them, there are many data-driven artificial intelligence calculations and analyses, all of which are calculated and analyzed based on electric power big data. However, for the massive electric power big data, it is impossible to obtain more internally related information only by observing the data from the surface. To a certain extent, it directly affects the upper-level advanced applications. To solve this problem, this paper studies and proposes a curve-mean clustering algorithm for load big data, which is the most widely used load data in smart grid. By analyzing the advanced measurement infrastructure, the matrix low-rank property of load big data and the calculation of singular value, the curve mean clustering of load big data is realized, and the optimal determination method of cluster number is expounded. Experiments are conducted based on actual resident user load data and compared with the classic mean shift clustering algorithm. By calculating the average distance within the cluster, the average distance between clusters and the DI index, it is verified that the proposed method clustering is more accurate and the selection of cluster number is optimal. The research plays a very good role in basic analysis for improving the big data analysis capability and data quality of smart grid.},

This characteristic that defines the quality or reliability of the data and its sources must be verified in the future systems of each company. In this paper, we present an approach that helps to improve the quality of Big Data by the distributed execution of algorithms for detecting and correcting data errors. The idea is to have a multi-agents model for errors detection and correction in big data flow. This model linked to a repository specific to each company. This repository contains the most frequent errors, metadata, error types, error detection algorithms and error correction algorithms. Each agent of this model represents an algorithm and will be deployed in multiple instances when needed. The use of these agents will go through two steps. In the first step, the detection agents and error correction agents manage each flow entering the system in real time. In the second step, all the processed data flows in first step will be a dataset to which the error detection and correction agents are applied in batch in order to process other types of errors. Among architectures who allow this processing type, we have chosen Lambda architecture.},

This paper addresses the QBD at the pre-processing phase, which includes sub-processes like cleansing, integration, filtering, and normalization. We propose a QBD model incorporating processes to support Data quality profile selection and adaptation. In addition, it tracks and registers on a data provenance repository the effect of every data transformation happened in the pre-processing phase. We evaluate the data quality selection module using large EEG dataset. The obtained results illustrate the importance of addressing QBD at an early phase of Big Data processing lifecycle since it significantly save on costs and perform accurate data analysis.},

Then, we propose a coherent, unified framework that extends BDVC with security and quality aspects.

Consequently, we propose an across-the-board quality management framework describing the key quality evaluation practices to be conducted through the different Big Data stages. The framework can be used to leverage the quality management and to provide a roadmap for Data scientists to better understand quality practices and highlight the importance of managing the quality.

In this regard, I explore the mechanism of the national standard reference data (SRD) program of Korea, which connects various scientific and social sectors to metrology by applying useful metrological concepts and methods to produce reliable data and convert such data into national standards. In particular, the changing interpretation of metrological key concepts, such as “measurement,” “traceability,” and “uncertainty,” will be explored and reconsidered from the perspective of data quality assurance. As a result, I suggest the concept of “data traceability” with “the matrix of data quality evaluation” according to the elements of a data production system and related evaluation criteria. To conclude, I suggest social and policy implications for the new role of metrology and standards for producing and disseminating reliable knowledge sources from big data.},

This paper aims to qualitatively assess the possibilities for using machine learning in the process of detecting data incompleteness and inaccuracy, since these two data quality dimensions were found to be the most significant by a previous research study conducted by the authors. A review of existing literature concludes that there is no unique machine learning algorithm most suitable to deal with both incompleteness and inaccuracy of data. Various algorithms are selected from existing studies and applied against a representative big (healthcare) dataset. Following experiments, it was also discovered that the implementation of machine learning algorithms in this context encounters several challenges for Big Data quality activities. These challenges are related to the amount of data particualar machine learning algorithms can scale to and also to certain data type restrictions imposed by some machine learning algorithms. The study concludes that 1) data imputation works better with linear regression models, 2) clustering models are more efficient to detect outliers but fully automated systems may not be realistic in this context. Therefore, a certain level of human judgement is still needed.},

abstract = {Big Data is quickly becoming a chief part of the decision-making process in both industry and academia. As more and more institutions begin relying on Big Data to make strategic decisions, the quality of the underlying data comes into question. The quality of Big Data isn’t always transparent and large-scale systems may even lack its visibility, which adversely affects the credibility of the Big Data systems. Continuous monitoring and measurement of data quality is therefore paramount in assessing whether the information can serve its purpose in a particular context (such as Big Data analytics, for example). This research addresses the need for Big Data quality measurement modeling and automation by proposing a novel conceptual quality measurement framework for Big Data (MEGA) with the purpose of assessing the underlying quality characteristics of Big Data (also known as the V’s of Big Data) at each step of the Big Data Pipelines. The theoretical quality measurement models for four of the Big Data V’s (Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity) are currently automated; the remaining 6 V’s (Vincularity, Validity, Value, Volatility, Valence and Vitality) will be tackled in our future work. The approach is illustrated on a case study.},

It proposes a process which aims to provide a systematic data quality assurance even without involving a medical domain expert. Especially when (re-)using clinical data, data quality is an important topic because clinical data are not purposely collected. Therefore, data driven conclusions might be false, because a given dataset is not representative. These false data driven conclusions could even harm the life of patients. Thus, all researchers should adhere to some basic principles that can prevent false conclusions. Twelve empirical experiments were conducted in order to prove that my process is able to assure data quality with respect to the descriptive and predictive analysis. Descriptive results obtained by applying stratified sampling are conflicting in four out of nine population inputs. Sampling is carried based on the top ranked feature drawn by the Contextual Data Quality Assurance (CDQA). Between datasets these features are confirmed by the Mutual Data Quality Assurance (MDQA). Stratified sampled inputs improve predictive results compared to raw data. Both Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores and accuracy scores increase by three percent.},

abstract = {Web application technologies are growing rapidly with continuous innovation and improvements. This paper focuses on the popular Spring Boot [1] java-based framework for building web and enterprise applications and how it provides the flexibility for service-oriented architecture (SOA). One challenge with any Spring-based applications is its level of complexity with configurations. Spring Boot makes it easy to create and deploy stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications with very little Spring configuration. Example, if we consider Spring Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework [2], we need to configure dispatcher servlet, web jars, a view resolver, and component scan among other things. To solve this, Spring Boot provides several Auto Configuration options to setup the application with any needed dependencies. Another challenge is to identify the framework dependencies and associated library versions required to develop a web application. Spring Boot offers simpler dependency management by using a comprehensive, but flexible, framework and the associated libraries in one single dependency, which provides all the Spring related technology that you need for starter projects as compared to CRUD web applications. This framework provides a range of additional features that are common across many projects such as embedded server, security, metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration. Web applications are generally packaged as war and deployed to a web server, but Spring Boot application can be packaged either as war or jar file, which allows to run the application without the need to install and/or configure on the application server. In this paper, we discuss how Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Data Center (ADC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is using Spring Boot to create a SOA based REST [4] service API, that bridges the gap between frontend user interfaces and backend database. Using this REST service API, ARM scientists are now able to submit reports via a user form or a command line interface, which captures the same data quality or other important information about ARM data.},

abstract = {Data quality is a challenging problem in many real world application domains. While a lot of attention has been given to detect anomalies for data at rest, detecting anomalies for streaming applications still largely remains an open problem. For applications involving several data streams, the challenge of detecting anomalies has become harder over time, as data can dynamically evolve in subtle ways following changes in the underlying infrastructure. In this paper, we describe and empirically evaluate an online anomaly detection pipeline that satisfies two key conditions: generality and scalability. Our technique works on numerical data as well as on categorical data and makes no assumption on the underlying data distributions. We implement two metrics, relative entropy and Pearson correlation, to dynamically detect anomalies. The two metrics we use provide an efficient and effective detection of anomalies over high velocity streams of events. In the following, we describe the design and implementation of our approach in a Big Data scenario using state-of-the-art streaming components. Specifically, we build on Kafka queues and Spark Streaming for realizing our approach while satisfying the generality and scalability requirements given above. We show how a combination of the two metrics we put forward can be applied to detect several types of anomalies - like infrastructure failures, hardware misconfiguration or user-driven anomalies - in large-scale telecommunication networks. We also discuss the merits and limitations of the resulting architecture and empirically evaluate its scalability on a real deployment over live streams capturing events from millions of mobile devices.},

Typically, organizational data error and outlier detection processes perform manually and reactively, making them time-consuming and prone to human errors. Additionally, rich data types, unlabeled data, and increased volume have made such data more complex. Accordingly, an automated anomaly detection approach is required to improve data management and quality control processes. This study introduces an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on models comparison, consensus learning, and a combination of rules of thumb with iterative hyper-parameter tuning to increase data quality. Furthermore, a domain expert is considered a human in the loop to evaluate and check the data quality and to judge the output of the unsupervised model. An experiment has been conducted to assess the proposed approach in the context of a case study. The experiment results confirm that the proposed approach can improve the quality of organizational data and facilitate anomaly detection processes.},

The Big Data processing, storage and analytics, of course, are major challenges that are most easily recognized. However, there are additional challenges related for instance to Big Data collection, integration, and quality enforcement. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to Big Data quality evaluation across the Big Data value chain. It consists of assessing first the quality of Big Data itself, which involve processes such as cleansing, filtering and approximation. Then, assessing the quality of process handling this Big Data, which involve for example processing and analytics process. We conduct a set of experiments to evaluate Quality of Data prior and after its pre-processing, and the Quality of the pre-processing and processing on a large dataset. Quality metrics have been measured to access three Big Data quality dimensions: accuracy, completeness, and consistency. The results proved that combination of data-driven and process-driven quality evaluation lead to improved quality enforcement across the Big Data value chain. Hence, we recorded high prediction accuracy and low processing time after we evaluate 6 well-known classification algorithms as part of processing and analytics phase of Big Data value chain.},

abstract = {The railways worldwide are increasingly looking to the integration of their data resources coupled with advanced analytics to enhance traffic management, to provide new insights on the health of infrastructure assets, to provide soft linkages to other transport modes, and ultimately to enable them to better serve their customers. As in many industrial sectors, over the past decade the rail industry has been investing heavily in sensing technologies that record every aspect of the operation of the railway network. However, as any data scientist knows, it does not matter how good an algorithm is, if you put rubbish in, you get rubbish out; and as the traditional industry model of working with data only within the system that it was collected by becomes increasingly fragile, the industry is discovering that it knows less than it thought about the data it is gathering. When coupled with legacy data resources of unknown accuracy, such as design diagrams for assets that in many cases are decades old, the rail industry now faces a crisis in which its data may become essentially worthless due to a poor understanding of the quality of its data. This paper reports the findings of the first phase of a three-phase systematic review of literature about how data quality can be managed and evaluated in the rail domain. It begins by discussing why data quality matters in a rail context, before going on to define the quality, introduce and expand the concept of a data quality schema.},

The specification of these constraints can be incomplete because domain experts typically specify them in an ad hoc manner. Existing automated test approaches can generate false alarms and do not explain the constraint violations while reporting faulty data records. In previous work, we proposed ADQuaTe, which is an automated data quality test approach that uses an unsupervised deep learning techni que (1) to discover constraints from big datasets that may have been missed by experts, and (2) to label as suspicious those records that violate the constraints. These records are grouped and explanations for constraint violations are presented to domain experts who determine whether or not the groups are actually faulty. This paper presents ADQuaTe2, which extends ADQuaTe to use an interactive learning technique that incorporates expert feedback to retrain the learning model and improve the accuracy of constraint discovery and fault detection. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach on real-world datasets from a health data warehouse and a plant diagnosis database. We also use datasets with known faults from the UCI repository to evaluate the improvement in the accuracy of the approach after incorporating ground truth knowledge.},

abstract = {In this era of big data, as relational databases are inefficient, NoSQL databases are a workable solution for data storage. In this context, one of the key issues is the veracity and therefore the data quality. Indeed, as with classic data, geospatial big data are generally fuzzy even though they are stored as crisp data (perfect data). Hence, if data are geospatial and fuzzy, additional complexities appear because of the complex syntax and semantic features of such data. The NoSQL databases do not offer strict data consistency. Therefore, new challenges are needed to be overcome to develop efficient methods that simultaneously ensure the performance and the consistency in storing fuzzy geospatial big data. This paper presents a new methodology that tackles the storage issues and validates the fuzzy spatial entities' consistency in a document-based NoSQL system. Consequently, first, to better express the structure of fuzzy geospatial data in such a system, we present a logical model called Fuzzy GeoJSON schema. Second, for consistent storage, we implement a schema-driven pipeline based on the Fuzzy GeoJSON schema and semantic constraints.},

This paper provides informative discussions for big data validation and quality assurance, including the essential concepts, focuses, and validation process. Moreover, the paper presents a comparison among big data validation tools and several major players in industry are discussed. Furthermore, the primary issues, challenges, and needs are discussed.},

abstract = {The project Death and Burial Data: Ireland 1864-1922 (DBDIrl) examines the relationship between historical death registration data and burial data to explore the history of power in Ireland from 1864 to 1922. Its core Big Data arises from historical records from a variety of heterogeneous sources, some aspects are pre-digitized and machine readable. A huge data set (over 4 million records in each source) and its slow manual enrichment (ca 7,000 records processed so far) pose issues of quality, scalability, and creates the need for a quality assurance technology that is accessible to non-programmers. An important goal for the researcher community is to produce a reusable, high-level quality assurance tool for the ingested data that is domain specific (historic data), highly portable across data sources, thus independent of storage technology.This paper outlines the step-wise design of the finer granular digital format, aimed for storage and digital archiving, and the design and test of two generations of the techniques, used in the first two data ingestion and cleaning phases.The first small scale phase was exploratory, based on metadata enrichment transcription to Excel, and conducted in parallel with the design of the final digital format and the discovery of all the domain-specific rules and constraints for the syntax and semantic validity of individual entries. Excel embedded quality checks or database-specific techniques are not adequate due to the technology independence requirement. This first phase produced a Java parser with an embedded data cleaning and evaluation classifier, continuously improved and refined as insights grew. The next, larger scale phase uses a bespoke Historian Web Application that embeds the Java validator from the parser, as well as a new Boolean classifier for valid and complete data assurance built using a Model-Driven Development technique that we also describe. This solution enforces property constraints directly at data capture time, removing the need for additional parsing and cleaning stages. The new classifier is built in an easy to use graphical technology, and the ADD-Lib tool it uses is a modern low-code development environment that auto-generates code in a large number of programming languages. It thus meets the technology independence requirement and historians are now able to produce new classifiers themselves without being able to program. We aim to infuse the project with computational and archival thinking in order to produce a robust data set that is FAIR compliant (Free Accessible Inter-operable and Re-useable).},

abstract = {A huge amount of data is constantly being produced in the world. Data coming from the IoT, from scientific simulations, or from any other field of the eScience, are accumulated over historical data sets and set up the seed for future Big Data processing, with the final goal to generate added value and discover knowledge. In such computing processes, data are the main resource, however, organizing and managing data during their entire life cycle becomes a complex research topic. As part of this, Data LifeCycle (DLC) models have been proposed to efficiently organize large and complex data sets, from creation to consumption, in any field, and any scale, for an effective data usage and big data exploitation. 2. Several DLC frameworks can be found in the literature, each one defined for specific environments and scenarios. However, we realized that there is no global and comprehensive DLC model to be easily adapted to different scientific areas. For this reason, in this paper we describe the Comprehensive Scenario Agnostic Data LifeCycle (COSA-DLC) model, a DLC model which: i) is proved to be comprehensive as it addresses the 6Vs challenges (namely Value, Volume, Variety, Velocity, Variability and Veracity, and ii), it can be easily adapted to any particular scenario and, therefore, fit the requirements of a specific scientific field. In this paper we also include two use cases to illustrate the ease of the adaptation in different scenarios. We conclude that the comprehensive scenario agnostic DLC model provides several advantages, such as facilitating global data management, organization and integration, easing the adaptation to any kind of scenario, guaranteeing good data quality levels and, therefore, saving design time and efforts for the scientific and industrial communities.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth in the use of various smart digital sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a swiftly growing technology, which has contributed significantly to Industry 4.0 and the promotion of IoT-based smart factories, which gives rise to the new challenges of big data analytics and the implementation of machine learning techniques. This article proposes a practical framework that combines IoT techniques, a data lake, data analysis, and cloud computing for manufacturing equipment health-state monitoring and diagnostics in smart manufacturing. It addresses all the required aspects in the realization of such a system and allows the seamless interchange of data and functionality. Due to the specific characteristics of IoT sensor data (low quality, redundant multisources, partial labeling), we not only provide a promising framework but also give detailed insights and pay considerable attention to data quality issues. In the proposed framework, an ingestion procedure is designed to manage data collection, data security, data transformation and data storage issues. To improve the quality of IoT big data, a high-noise feature filter is proposed for automated preliminary sensor selection to suppress noisy features, followed by a noisy data cleaning module to provide good quality data for unbiased diagnosis modeling. The proposed framework can achieve seamless integration between IoT big data ingestion from the physical factory and machine learning-based data analytics in the virtual systems. It is built on top of the Apache Spark processing engine, being capable of working in both big data and real-time environments. One case study has been conducted based on a four-stage syngas compressor from real industries, which won the Best Industry Application of IoT at the BigInsights Data &#x0026; AI Innovation Awards. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed IoT-architecture and techniques to address the data quality issues.},

Data quality issues arise after organizations have moved past clear-cut technical solutions to early bottlenecks in using data. Left unaddressed, such issues can and have led to high profile missteps, and raise doubts about the data-driven world view altogether. In this paper, we share real-world case studies of tackling data quality challenges across industry verticals. We present initial ideas on how to systematically address data quality issues via technology. The success of operationalizing big data will depend on the quality of data involved, and whether such data causes uncertainty and disruptions, or delivers genuine knowledge and value.},

The local client controls the hardware (i.e., spectrometer and stage) to collect SERS spectra from HP designed sensors, and offers the options to analyze, visualize and save the spectra with meta-data records, including relevant experimental conditions. The cloud server contains remote databases and web interface for centralized data management to users from different locations. Here we describe how this platform was built and demonstrate its use for automated sensor quality control based on sensor images. Sensor quality control is a common practice, employed in sensor production to select high performing sensors. Image-based approach is a natural way to perform sensor quality control without destructing the sensors. Automating this process using the proposed platform can also reduce the time spent and achieve consistent result by avoiding human visual inspection.},

abstract = {Recent developments in Internet of Things have heightened the need for data sharing across application domains to foster innovation. As most of these IoT deployments are based on heterogeneous sensor types, there is increased scope for sharing erroneous, inaccurate or inconsistent data. This in turn may lead to inaccurate models built from this data. It is important to evaluate this data as it is collected to establish its quality. This paper presents an analysis of data quality as it is represented in Internet of Things (IoT) systems and some of the limitations of this representation. The paper then introduces the use of trust as a heuristic to drive data quality measurements. Trust is a well-established metric that has been used to determine the validity of a piece or source of data in crowd sourced or other unreliable data collection techniques. The analysis extends to detail an appropriate framework for representing data quality within the big data model. To demonstrate the application of a trust backed framework, we used data collected from a IoT deployment of sensors to measure air quality in which a low cost sensor was co-located with a gold reference sensor. Using data streams modeled based on a dataset from an IoT deployment, our initial results show that the framework's trust score are consistent with the accuracy measure of the machine learning models.},

While the existing data governance focuses on the processing of structured data, Big Data governance needs to be established in consideration of a broad sense of Big Data services including unstructured data. To achieve the goals of Big Data, strategies need to be established together with goals that are aligned with the vision and objective of an organization. In addition to the preparation of the IT infrastructure, a proper preparation of the components is required to effectively implement the strategy for Big Data services. We propose the Big Data Governance Framework in this paper. The Big Data governance framework presents criteria different from existing criteria at the data quality level. It focuses on timely, reliable, meaningful, and sufficient data services, focusing on what data attributes should be achieved based on the data attributes of Big Data services. In addition to the quality level of Big Data, the personal information protection strategy and the data disclosure/accountability strategy are also needed to achieve goals and to prevent problems. This paper performed case analysis based on the Big Data Governance Framework with the National Pension Service of South Korea.

abstract = {Manufacturing test data volumes are constantly increasing. While there has been extensive focus in the literature on big data processing, less focus has existed on data quality, and considerably less focus has been placed specifically on manufacturing test data quality. This paper presents a fully automated test data quality measurement developed by the authors to facilitate analysis of manufacturing test operations, resulting in a single number used to compare manufacturing test data quality across programs and factories, and focusing effort cost-effectively. The automation enables program and factory users to see, understand, and improve their test data quality directly. Immediate improvements in test data quality speed manufacturing test operation analysis, reducing elapsed time and overall spend in test operations. Data quality has significant financial impacts to businesses [1]. While manufacturing cost models are well understood, data quality cost models are less well understood (see Eppler & Helfert [2] who review manufacturing cost models and create a taxonomy for data quality costs). Kim & Choi [3] discuss measuring data quality costs, and a rudimentary data quality cost calculation is described in [4]. Haug et al. [5] describe a classification of costs for poor data quality, and while they do not provide a cost calculation, they do define optimality for data quality. Laranjeiro et al. [6] have a recent survey of poor data quality classification. Ge & Helfert [7] extend the work in [2], and provide an updated review of data quality costs. Test data is specifically addressed in the context of data processing in [8]. Big data quality efforts are reviewed in [9, 10]. Data quality metrics are discussed in [11], and requirements for data quality metrics are identified in [12]. Data inconsistencies are detailed in [13], while categorical data inconsistencies are explained in [14]. In the current work, manufacturing test data quality is directly correlated to the speed of manufacturing test operations analysis. A measurement for manufacturing test data quality indicates the speed at which analysis can be performed, and increases in the test data quality score have precipitated increases in the speed of analysis, described herein.},

These networks may be real (conventional) or virtual (in case of services hosted in data centers). Either way, the responsibility of smooth execution of the application, despite increasing traffic volume, lies with the service provider. The service providers face many challenges with respect to providing a high quality of service. It is therefore in the best interest of the service providers that efficiency of the applications is increased. SDN has the potential to improve big data application performance. In this paper we have a look at the recent advancements in technology that helps improve big data applications using SDN and discuss our observations.},

Data quality is a multi-dimensional factor that affects the analysis in numerous ways. Among all the dimensions, accuracy is the most important and hardest dimension to assess. With the advent of big data, this problem becomes more complicated. There are only few studies that focus on data accuracy with minimal domain expert dependency. In this paper, we propose an extensive data accuracy assessment tool that uses machine learning to determine the accuracy of data. In addition, our model also addresses the intrinsic and contextual categories of data accuracy. Our model was developed on Apache Spark which serves as the big data environment for handling large datasets.},

We first propose an intelligent Big Data pre-processing approach and a data quality score to measure and ensure the data quality and data faithfulness. Then, a new weight based ensemble algorithm is proposed to learn a BN structure from an ensemble of local results. To easily integrate the algorithm with DDP engines, such as Hadoop, we employ Kepler scientific workflow to build the whole learning process. We demonstrate how Kepler can facilitate building and running our Big Data BN learning application. Our experiments show good scalability and learning accuracy when running the application in real distributed environments.},

Low-quality data can result in incorrect analytics results and may lead to no value even harmful conclusions. Therefore, it is important to provide an effective mechanism for ensuring data quality improvement in a big data service. We describe the implement ion of a deep learning classifier to automatically filter low quality data in datasets. To improve the effectiveness of data separation, the classifier is rigorously validated with synthetic data generated by a collection of scientific tools.

Recently advances in ASR married with big data technologies drive more personalized services in many areas of services. A speaker adaptation is now a well-accepted technology that requires huge computation cost in creating a personalized acoustic model and corresponding language model over several billions of Samsung product users. We implement a personalized and scalable ASR system powered by the big data infrastructure which brings data-driven personalized opportunities to voice-enabled services such as voice-to-text transcriber, voice-enabled web search in a peta bytes scale. We verify the feasibility of speaker adaptation based on 107 testers' recordings and obtain about 10% of recognition accuracy. An optimal set of performance optimization is suggested to have the best performance such as workflow compaction, file compression, best file system selection among several distributed file systems.},

Therefore the various online applications where the huge data request are generated are treated using the big data i.e. facebook, google. In this presented work the big data environment is studied and investigated how the data is consumed using the big data and how the supporting tools are working with the Hadoop storage. Furthermore, for keen understanding and investigation, a cluster analysis technique more specifically the K-mean clustering algorithm is implemented through the Hadoop and MapReduce. The clustering is a part of big data analytics where the unlabelled data is processed and utilized to make groups of the data. In addition of that it is observed the traditional k-mean algorithm is not much suitably works with the Hadoop and MapReduce thus small amount of modification is performed on the data processing technique. In addition of that during cluster analysis various issues are found in traditional k-means i.e. fluctuating accuracy, outliers and empty cluster. Therefore a new clustering algorithm with modification on traditional approach of k-means clustering is proposed and implemented. That approach first enhances the data quality by removing the outlier points in datasets and then the bi-part method is used to perform the clustering. The proposed clustering technique implemented using the JAVA, Hadoop and MapReduce finally the performance of the proposed clustering approach is evaluated and compared with the traditional k-means clustering algorithm. The obtained performance shows the effective results and enhanced accuracy of cluster formation with the removal of the de-efficiency. Thus the proposed work is adoptable for the big data environment with improving the performance of clustering.},

Processing Big data involves selecting the appropriate services and resources thanks to the variety of services offered by different Cloud providers.

In this paper, we propose a dynamic cloud service selection scheme that assess Big data requirements, dynamically map these to the most available cloud services, and then recommend the best match services that fulfill different Big data processing requests. Our selection is conducted in two stages: 1) relies on a Big data task profile that efficiently capture Big data task's requirements and map them to QoS parameters, and then classify cloud providers that best satisfy these requirements, 2) uses the list of selected providers from stage 1 to further select the appropriate Cloud services to fulfill the overall Big Data task requirements. We extend the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based ranking mechanism to cope with the problem of multi-criteria selection.

abstract = {The operation of complex AC/DC power grid changes rapidly and dynamically, which objectively puts forward higher requirements for on-line analysis, and it is urgent to improve the basic data quality of power grid. Because of low quality and poor synchronization of the basic data of power grid, it is impossible to accurately map the actual operation of the power grid. At the same time, the cross-system data matching degree is low and the data correlation is poor, so it can not support the multi-scale data analysis for all kinds of applications. In this paper, the associated method of multi-source heterogeneous data in the power grid is studied. Combined with big data's access characteristics, big data storage, big data retrieval and artificial intelligence technology, the high-speed data storage and index architecture of power big data are constructed, and a multi-dimensional index reflecting the associated relationship of operating data is established from the dimensions of time, space, application, device and so on. It is easier to analyze multi-source data, to improve the basic data quality of power grid, which provides effective support for accurate data analysis and evaluation of power grid.},

A huge amount of genomic data is publicly available and frequently used by the research community in order to extract meaningful and reliable gene-disease relationships. However, management of this exponential growth of data has become a challenge for biologists; under such a big data problem perspective, they are forced to delve into a lake of complex data spread in over thousand heterogeneous repositories, represented in multiple formats and with different levels of quality; but when data are used to solve a concrete problem only a small part of that “data lake” is really significant; this is what we call the “smart” data perspective. Using conceptual models and the principles of data quality management, adapted to the genomic domain, we propose a systematic approach to move from a big data to a smart data perspective. The aim of this approach is to populate an Information System with genomic data which must be accessible, informative and actionable enough to extract valuable knowledge.},

In fact, as organizations are harnessing multi-sources data to rise the benefits of their business, the quality of data becomes important and crucial. This paper presents a new approach to query big data sources using Resource Description Framework (RDF) representation to ensure data quality by harvesting more relevant and complete query results. Our approach handles two important types of heterogeneity over multiple data sources: semantic heterogeneity and URI-based entity identification. It proposes (1) a semantic entity resolution method based on inference mechanism using rules to manage the misunderstanding of data, in real world entities (2) Data Quality enhancement using MapReduce-based query rewriting approach includes the entity resolution results to infer and adds implicit data into query results (3) a parallel combination of MapReduce jobs of saturation and query rewriting inferences to handle transitive and cyclic rules for a richer rules' expression language (4) experiments to assess the efficiency of the proposed approach over real big RDF data originating from insurance and synthetic data sets.},

And in many learning behavior research, the sensor network usually consists of a host of mutually independent data sources, which can be used to monitor measured objects from multiple dimensions thereby obtaining the multi-source multi-modal sensory data. However, there still exist false negative readings, false positive readings and environmental interference, etc. Therefore, we propose a multi-source multimode sensory data acquisition method based on Date Quality(DQ). We first define the data quality in terms of four aspects-accuracy, integrity, consistency and instantaneity. Then, by the modeling there aspects respectively, we propose metrics to estimate the comprehensive data quality method of multi-source multi-mode sensory data. Finally, a data acquisition method is presented based on data quality, which selects a part of data sources for data transmission according to the given precision. This method aims at reducing the consumption of the sensory network on the premise of the data quality guarantee. An extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm.},

abstract = {A nonnegative latent factorization of tensors (NLFT) model precisely represents the temporal patterns hidden in multichannel data emerging from various applications. It often adopts a single latent factor-dependent, nonnegative and multiplicative update on tensor (SLF-NMUT) algorithm. However, learning depth in this algorithm is not adjustable, resulting in frequent training fluctuation or poor model convergence caused by overshooting. To address this issue, this study carefully investigates the connections between the performance of an NLFT model and its learning depth via SLF-NMUT to present a joint learning-depth-adjusting scheme for it. Based on this scheme, a Depth-adjusted Multiplicative Update on tensor algorithm is innovatively proposed, thereby achieving a novel depth-adjusted nonnegative latent-factorization-of-tensors (DNL) model. Empirical studies on two industrial data sets demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art NLFT models, a DNL model achieves significant accuracy gain when performing missing data estimation on a high-dimensional and incomplete tensor with high efficiency. Note to Practitioners—Multichannel data are often encountered in various big-data-related applications. It is vital for a data analyzer to correctly capture the temporal patterns hidden in them for efficient knowledge acquisition and representation. This article focuses on analyzing temporal QoS data, which is a representative kind of multichannel data. To correctly extract their temporal patterns, an analyzer should correctly describe their nonnegativity. Such a purpose can be achieved by building a nonnegative latent factorization of tensors (NLFT) model relying on a single latent factor-dependent, nonnegative and multiplicative update on tensor (SLF-NMUT) algorithm. But its learning depth is not adjustable, making an NLFT model frequently suffer from severe fluctuations in its training error or even fail to converge. To address this issue, this study carefully investigates the learning rules for an NLFT model’s decision parameters using an SLF-NMUT and proposes a joint learning-depth-adjusting scheme. This scheme manipulates the multiplicative terms in SLF-NMUT-based learning rules linearly and exponentially, thereby making the learning depth adjustable. Based on it, this study builds a novel depth-adjusted nonnegative latent-factorization-of-tensors (DNL) model. Compared with the existing NLFT models, a DNL model better represents multichannel data. It meets industrial needs well and can be used to achieve high performance in data analysis tasks like temporal-aware missing data estimation},

abstract = {In the age of big data, services in the pervasive edge environment are expected to offer end-users better Quality-of-Experience (QoE) than that in a normal edge environment. However, the combined impact of the storage, delivery, and sensors used in various types of edge devices in this environment is producing volumes of high-dimensional big data that are increasingly pervasive and redundant. Therefore, enhancing the QoE has become a major challenge in high-dimensional big data in the pervasive edge computing environment. In this paper, to achieve high QoE, we propose a QoE model for evaluating the qualities of services in the pervasive edge computing environment. The QoE is related to the accuracy of high-dimensional big data and the transmission rate of this accurate data. To realize high accuracy of high-dimensional big data and the transmission of accurate data through out the pervasive edge computing environment, in this study we focused on the following two aspects. First, we formulate the issue as a high-dimensional big data management problem and test different transmission rates to acquire the best QoE. Then, with respect to accuracy, we propose a Tensor-Fast Convolutional Neural Network (TF-CNN) algorithm based on deep learning, which is suitable for high-dimensional big data analysis in the pervasive edge computing environment. Our simulation results reveal that our proposed algorithm can achieve high QoE performance.},

abstract = {Recent technological advances in modern healthcare have lead to the ability to collect a vast wealth of patient monitoring data. This data can be utilised for patient diagnosis but it also holds the potential for use within medical research. However, these datasets often contain errors which limit their value to medical research, with one study finding error rates ranging from 2.3%-26.9% in a selection of medical databases. Previous methods for automatically assessing data quality normally rely on threshold rules, which are often unable to correctly identify errors, as further complex domain knowledge is required. To combat this, a semantic web based framework has previously been developed to assess the quality of medical data. However, early work, based solely on traditional semantic web technologies, revealed they are either unable or inefficient at scaling to the vast volumes of medical data. In this paper we present a new method for storing and querying medical RDF datasets using Hadoop Map / Reduce. This approach exploits the inherent parallelism found within RDF datasets and queries, allowing us to scale with both dataset and system size. Unlike previous solutions, this framework uses highly optimised (SPARQL) joining strategies, intelligent data caching and the use of a super-query to enable the completion of eight distinct SPARQL lookups, comprising over eighty distinct joins, in only two Map / Reduce iterations. Results are presented comparing both the Jena and a previous Hadoop implementation demonstrating the superior performance of the new methodology. The new method is shown to be five times faster than Jena and twice as fast as the previous approach.},

Emphasis is often placed on the quality assessment of individual observations from sensors but not on the sensors themselves nor upon site metadata such as location and timestamps. The focus of this paper is on the development and evaluation of a representative and comprehensive, interpolation-based methodology for assessment of spatio-temporal data quality. We call our method the SMART method, short for Simple Mappings for the Approximation and Regression of Time series. When applied to a real-world, meteorological data set, we show that our method outperforms standard interpolators and we identify numerous problematic sites that otherwise would not have been flagged as bad. We further identify sites for which metadata is incorrect. We believe that there are many problems with real data sets like these and, in the absence of an approach like ours, these problems have largely gone unidentified. Our results bring into question the validity of provider-based quality control indicators. In addition to providing a comprehensive solution, our approach is novel for the simple but effective way that it accounts for spatial and temporal variation.},

While it is trivial to spot poor data for small-scale and offline use cases, it is challenging to detect and fix data inconsistency in large-scale and online (real-time or near-real time) big data context. An example of such scenario is spotting and fixing poor data using Apache Samza, a stream processing framework that has been increasingly adopted to process near-real-time data at LinkedIn. To optimize the deployment of Samza processing and reduce business cost, in this work we propose a memory capacity model for Apache Samza to allow denser deployments of high performing data-filtering applications built on Samza. The model can be used to provision just-enough memory resource to applications by tightening the bounds on the memory allocations. We apply our memory capacity model on Linkedln's real use cases in production, which significantly increases the deployment density and saves business costs.

abstract = {Flight delay has been a serious and widespread problem that needs to be solved. One promising solution is the flight delay prediction. Although big data analytics and machine learning have been applied successfully in many domains, their applications in aviation are limited. This paper presents a comprehensive study of flight delay spanning data pre-processing, data visualization and data mining, in which we develop several machine learning models to predict flight arrival delays. Two data sets were used, namely Airline On-Time Performance (AOTP) Data and Quality Controlled Local Climatological Data (QCLCD). This paper aims to recognize useful patterns of the flight delay from aviation data and perform accurate delay prediction. The best result for flight delay prediction (five classes) using machine learning models is 89.07% (Multilayer Perceptron). A Convolution neural network model is also built which is enlightened by the idea of pattern recognition and success of neural network method, showing a slightly better result with 89.32% prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {Global climate crisis in 21st century pushed countries to move towards energy transformation in generation and consumption. To achieve green and low-carbon energy transformation goals, it is necessary that a large number of renewable energy resources such as wind and solar to be consumed. Renewable energy with intermittent fluctuations in time dimension and agglomerations in spatial dimension increases the complexity of green energy consumption friendly. Therefore, comprehensive data and advanced predictive analysis methods are required to guarantee safety of operation and transactions for renewable energy plants and stations. We can even say that quality of renewable energy data determines the accuracy of prediction and analysis. Firstly, this article analyzes the operation and transaction characteristics of distributed renewable energy plants, and data quality analysis framework for distributed renewable energy operations and transactions was built on the new energy cloud platform. Data information were classified into model parameter and status instance, which are related to dispatching and energy power transaction businesses such as equipment model management, operation monitoring and security analysis, measurement statistics etc. The importance between them is determined according to pairwise comparison. Finally, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) theory was applied to calculate weights for data integrity, accuracy, consistency and timeliness, data quality assessment process and calculation methods were designed, and load series data was used to verify its correctness.},

abstract = {Accurate data is a key success factor influencing the performance of data analytics results, especially for the detection and prediction purpose. Nowadays, Big Data analytics (BDA) is used to analyze the sheer volume of data available in an organization. These data quality must be maintained in order to obtain correct alert and valuable insights from the rapidly changing data of high volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value. This paper aim is to modify existing framework of big data analytics by improving an important step in pre-processing (i.e. Data Cleaning). Initially, feature selection based on Random Forest is used to extract effective features. Then, two classifier algorithms (i.e. Random Forest classifier and Linear SVM classifier) are applied to train using the dataset to classify data quality and to develop an intelligent model. In evaluation, our experimental results show a consistent accuracy of Random Forest and Linear Regression around 90%. Using this approach, we expect to provide a set of cleaned data for further processing. Besides, analysts can benefit from this system in data analytical process in cleaning stage and conclude that the data is cleaned. Finally, a comparison is presented between available functions which are used to handle missing values with the developed system.},

abstract = {Frequent itemset mining is used to extract interesting associations and correlations between the itemsets present in transactional datasets. The frequently appearing patterns are used for various business decision making policies, for instance to increase co-purchase of products, price optimization, cross promotion etc. However, there are some sensitive patterns present in datasets that can reveal individual or organisation's specific confidential information that they would not prefer to be known since it can cause them huge social and monetary loss. Privacy Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) approaches are used to hide these sensitive patterns with maintaining the utility of the data. Heuristics-based PPDM approaches are widely adopted sensitive pattern hiding approaches due to their simplicity and lesser computational time as compared to the border-based and exact approaches. However, these approaches causes high side effects concerning the quality of datasets. In this paper, two heuristics-based algorithms, Removal of Closed Sensitive Itemsets with Maximum Support (MaxRCSI) and Removal of Closed Sensitive Itemsets with Minimum Support (MinRCSI), are proposed. In these algorithms, data sanitization is performed over closed sensitive itemsets to improve the utility of sanitized data. The proposed algorithms are parallelized on Spark parallel computing framework to deal with the massive amount of data i.e. big data. Experiments performed on real and synthetic datasets show that the proposed algorithms preserve the privacy of datasets with substantially better utility as compared to the traditional algorithms with less execution time.},

Multiple nations around the world have been seeking novel effective ways to make sense of "big data" for evidence-based, outcome-driven, and affordable 5P (Patient-centric, Predictive, Preventive, Personalized, and Precise) healthcare. My main research focus is on multi-modal and multi-scale (i.e. molecular, cellular, whole body, individual, and population) biomedical data analytics for discovery, development, and delivery, including translational bioinformatics in biomarker discovery for personalized care; imaging informatics in histopathology for clinical diagnosis decision support; bionanoinformatics for minimally-invasive image-guided surgery; critical care informatics in ICU for real-time evidence-based decision making; and chronic care informatics for patient-centric health. In this talk, first, I will highlight major challenges in biomedical and health informatics pipeline consisting of data quality control, information feature extraction, advanced knowledge modeling, decision making, and proper action taking through feedback. Second, I will present informatics methodological research in (i) data integrity and integration; (ii) case-based reasoning for individualized care; and (iii) streaming data analytics for real-time decision support using a few mobile health case studies (e.g. Sickle Cell Disease, asthma, pain management, rehabilitation, diabetes etc.). Last, there is big shortage of data scientists and engineers who are capable of handling Big Data. In addition, there is an urgent need to educate healthcare stakeholders (i.e. patients, physicians, payers, and hospitals) on how to tackle these grant challenges. I will discuss efforts such as patient-centric educational intervention, community-based crowd sourcing, and Biomedical Data Analytics MOOC development.

abstract = {Data Quality (DQ) has been one of the key focuses as Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) fields continue to grow. Yet, data quality analysis has mostly been a disjointed, ad-hoc, and cumbersome process in the overall data analysis workflow. There have been ongoing attempts to formalize this process, but the solutions that have come out are not universally applicable. Most of the proposed solutions try to address the problem of data quality from a limited perspective and suc-cessfully address only a subset of all challenges. These solutions fail to translate to other domains due to a lack of structure. In this paper, we present DQLearn, a toolkit for structured data quality learning. We start by presenting the core principle on which we build our library and introduce the four components that provide a solid base to address the needs of the data quality problem. Then, we showcase our automation structure - "Workflows", and the two optimization techniques equipped with it, that help the users to structure their learning problem very easily. Next, we discuss four important scenarios of the DQ Workflows in the overall life-cycle. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed toolkit with public datasets and show benchmark results from optimization experiments.},

Recent studies have shown that poor quality data is prevalent in large databases and on the Web. Since poor quality data can have serious consequences on the results of data analyses, the importance of veracity, the fourth `V' of big data is increasingly being recognized. In this tutorial, we highlight the substantial challenges that the first three `V's, volume, velocity and variety, bring to dealing with veracity in big data. Due to the sheer volume and velocity of data, one needs to understand and (possibly) repair erroneous data in a scalable and timely manner. With the variety of data, often from a diversity of sources, data quality rules cannot be specified a priori; one needs to let the “data to speak for itself” in order to discover the semantics of the data. This tutorial presents recent results that are relevant to big data quality management, focusing on the two major dimensions of (i) discovering quality issues from the data itself, and (ii) trading-off accuracy vs efficiency, and identifies a range of open problems for the community.},

abstract = {Smart urban transportation management can be considered as a multifaceted big data challenge. It strongly relies on the information collected into multiple, widespread, and heterogeneous data sources as well as on the ability to extract actionable insights from them. Besides data, full stack (from platform to services and applications) Information and Communications Technology (ICT) solutions need to be specifically adopted to address smart cities challenges. Smart urban transportation management is one of the key use cases addressed in the context of the EUBra-BIGSEA (Europe-Brazil Collaboration of Big Data Scientific Research through Cloud-Centric Applications) project. This paper specifically focuses on the City Administration Dashboard, a public transport analytics application that has been developed on top of the EUBra-BIGSEA platform and used by the Municipality stakeholders of Curitiba, Brazil, to tackle urban traffic data analysis and planning challenges. The solution proposed in this paper joins together a scalable big and fast data analytics platform, a flexible and dynamic cloud infrastructure, data quality and entity matching algorithms as well as security and privacy techniques. By exploiting an interoperable programming framework based on Python Application Programming Interface (API), it allows an easy, rapid and transparent development of smart cities applications.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to investigate the impact of missing values in categorical time series sequences on common data analysis tasks. Being able to more effectively identify patterns in socio-demographic longitudinal data is an important component in a number of social science settings. However, performing fundamental analytical operations, such as clustering for grouping these data based on similarity patterns, is challenging due to the categorical and multi-dimensional nature of the data, and their corruption by missing and inconsistent values. To study these data quality issues, we employ longitudinal sequence data representations, a similarity measure designed for categorical and longitudinal data, together with state-of-the art clustering methodologies reliant on hierarchical algorithms. The key to quantifying the similarity and difference among data records is a distance metric. Given the categorical nature of our data, we employ an “edit” type distance using Optimal Matching (OM). Because each data record has multiple variables of different types, we investigate the impact of mixing these variables in a single similarity measure. Between variables with binary values and those with multiple nominal values, we find that the ability to overcome missing data problems is harder in the nominal domain versus the binary domain. Additionally, artificial clusters introduced by the alignment of leading missing values can be resolved by tuning the missing value substitution cost parameter.},

Crowd sensing data has also experienced many links in the process of network propagation, so it is inevitable that there are abnormal data in the database. Therefore, how to filter these unreliable data to get more real data is particularly important. This paper takes somatosensory temperature as an example, solves the problem of calculating the similarity of unequal long-term sequences by using DTW technology, and then clusters and compares the data in the database to find out the abnormal data. Thereby, the accuracy of the somatosensory temperature database is improved, and relevant users can obtain more accurate information. The experimental results show that when the minimum DTW value exceeds the threshold t  =  0.7, the more the number of simulation sequences, the more stable the accuracy rate, and the faster the growth rate of the running time.},

From a database systems perspective, we present a comprehensive survey of storage mechanisms, data processing algorithms, external algorithms, run-time memory management, consistency, optimizations and parallel processing. From a programming languages angle, we consider elegance, expressiveness, abstraction, composability, interactive behavior and automatic code optimization. We present a short experimental evaluation comparing the performance of the three languages on typical data exploration and pre-processing tasks. Our conclusion: there is no winner.},

abstract = {Record Linkage aims to find records in a dataset that represent the same real-world entity across many different data sources. It is a crucial task for data quality. With the evolution of Big Data, new difficulties appeared to deal mainly with the 5Vs of Big Data properties; i.e. Volume, Variety, Velocity, Value, and Veracity. Therefore Record Linkage in Big Data is more challenging. This paper investigates ways to apply Record Linkage algorithms that handle the Volume property of Big Data. Our investigation revealed four major issues. First, the techniques used to resolve the Volume property of Big Data mainly depend on partitioning the data into a number of blocks. The processing of those blocks is parallelly distributed among many executers. Second, MapReduce is the most famous programming model that is designed for parallel processing of Big Data. Third, a blocking key is usually used for partitioning the big dataset into smaller blocks; it is often created by the concatenation of the prefixes of chosen attributes. Partitioning using a blocking key may lead to unbalancing blocks, which is known as data skew, where data is not evenly distributed among blocks. An uneven distribution of data degrades the performance of the overall execution of the MapReduce model. Fourth, to the best of our knowledge, a small number of studies has been done so far to balance the load between data blocks in a MapReduce framework. Hence more work should be dedicated to balancing the load between the distributed blocks.},

Evaluation and results have shown that data quality and size were the most critical factors towards algorithmic accuracy. Result comparison showed that Decision Trees were more accurate than Logistic Regression.},

These personas are essential to better tailor financial products and improve customer retention. This framework is comprised of several components including anomaly detection, binning and aggregation of contextual data, clustering of transaction time series, and mining association rules that map contextual data to cluster identifiers. Leveraging rich transaction and contextual data available from nearly 60,000 retail and 90,000 business customers of a financial institution, we empirically evaluate this framework and describe how the identified association rules can be used to explain and refine existing customer classes, and identify new customer classes and various data quality issues. We also analyze the performance of the proposed framework and show that it can easily scale to millions of banking customers.},

abstract = {Todays' Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications majorly depend on either limited neighbouring traffic data or crowd sourced stale traffic data. Enabling big traffic data analytics in ITS environments is a step closer towards utilizing significant traffic patterns and trends for making more precise and intelligent decisions particularly in connected autonomous vehicular environments. Towards this end, this paper presents a Traffic Aware Data Offloading (TRADING) approach for big traffic data centric ITS applications in connected autonomous vehicular environments. Specifically, TRADING balances offloading data traffic among gateways focusing on vehicular traffic and network status in the vicinity of gateways. In addition, TRADING mitigates the effect of gateway advertisement overhead to liberate the transmission channels for traffic big data transmission. The performance of TRADING is comparatively evaluated in a realistic simulation environment by considering gateway access overhead, load distribution among gateways, data offloading delay, and data offloading success ratio. The comparative performance evaluation results show some significant developments towards enabling big traffic data centric ITS.},

abstract = {The presence of incorrect data leads to the decrease of condition-monitoring big data quality. As a result, unreliable or misleading results are probably obtained by analyzing these poor-quality data. In this paper, to improve the data quality, an incorrect data detection method based on an improved local outlier factor (LOF) is proposed for data cleaning. First, a sliding window technique is used to divide data into different segments. These segments are considered as different objects and their attributes consist of time-domain statistical features extracted from each segment, such as mean, maximum and peak-to-peak value. Second, a kernel-based LOF (KLOF) is calculated using these attributes to evaluate the degree of each segment being incorrect data. Third, according to these KLOF values and a threshold value, incorrect data are detected. Finally, a simulation of vibration data generated by a defective rolling element bearing and three real cases concerning a fixed-axle gearbox, a wind turbine, and a planetary gearbox are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to detect both missing segments and abnormal segments, which are two typical incorrect data, effectively, and thus is helpful for big data cleaning of machinery condition monitoring.},

abstract = {Recently, its becomes easy to track down the data due to its availability in a large number. Although for data management, processing, and obtainability, cloud computing is considered a well-known approach for organizational development on the internet. Despite many advantages, cloud computing has still numerous security challenges that can affect the big-data usage on cloud computing. To find the security issues/challenges that are faced by software vendors’ organizations we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) through which we have find out 103 relevant research publications by developing a search string that is inspired by the research questions. This relevant data was comprised from different databases e.g. Google Scholar, IEEE Explore, ScienceDirect, ACM Digital Library, and SpringerLink. Furthermore, for the detailed literature review, we have accomplished all the steps in SLR, for example, development of SLR protocol, Initials and final assortment of the relevant data, data extraction, data quality assessment, and data synthesis. We identified fifteen (15) critical security challenges which are: data secrecy, geographical data location, unauthorized data access, lack of control, lack of data management, network-level issues, data integrity, data recovery, lack of trust, data sharing, data availability, asset issues, legal amenabilities, lack of quality, and lack of consistency. Furthermore, sixty four (64) standard practices are identified for these critical security challenges using the proposed SLR that could help vendor organizations to overcome the security challenges for big data. The findings of our research study demonstrate the resemblances and divergences in the identified security challenges in different periods, continents, databases, and methods. The proposed SLR will also support software vendor organizations for securing big data on the cloud computing platforms. This paper has the following content: in Section II, we have describe the Literature review; in Section III, research methodology is specified; in Section IV, the findings of the SLR and the analysis of result are discussed; in Section V, the limitations of this research are given; in Section VI, we discussed our conclusions and future work.},

Customers benefit from higher quality of service enabled by Big Data. Service providers get higher profits from more precise control of costs and accurate knowledge of customer needs. In this paper, we define the next generation high quality services as Great Services, characterized by 4P Quality-of-Service (QoS) dimensions: Panorama, Penetration, Prediction and Personalization, which go much further than current services. The transformation of Big Data into Great Services would be difficult and expensive without methodical techniques and software tools. We call the intermediate step Deep Knowledge, which is generated by Big Data (with the 4V challenges - Volume, Velocity, Variety, and Veracity) and used in the creation of Great Services. Deep Knowledge is distinguished from traditional Big Data by 4C properties (Complexity, Cross-domain, Customization, and Convergence). In order to achieve the 4P QoS dimensions of Great Services, we need Deep Knowledge with 4C properties. In this paper, we describe an informal characterization of Great Services with 4P QoS dimensions with examples, and outline the techniques and tools that facilitate the transformation of Big Data into Deep Knowledge with 4C properties, and then the use of Deep Knowledge in Great Services.},

The quality of the data, i.e., the degree to which the data characteristics fulfill requirements, can have a tremendous impact on the businesses themselves, the companies, or even in human lives. In fact, research and industry reports show that huge amounts of capital are spent to improve the quality of the data being used in many systems, sometimes even only to understand the quality of the information in use. Considering the variety of dimensions, characteristics, business views, or simply the specificities of the systems being evaluated, understanding how to measure data quality can be an extremely difficult task. In this paper we survey the state of the art in classification of poor data, including the definition of dimensions and specific data problems, we identify frequently used dimensions and map data quality problems to the identified dimensions. The huge variety of terms and definitions found suggests that further standardization efforts are required. Also, data quality research on Big Data appears to be in its initial steps, leaving open space for further research.},

abstract = {Interconnection and intelligence have become the latest trends of the new generation of vehicle and transportation technologies. Applications built upon platforms of cloud-centered vehicle networking, i.e., Internet-of-Vehicles (IoVs), have been increasingly developed and deployed to provide data-centric services (e.g., driving assistance). Because these services are often safety critical, assuring service dependability has become an important requirement. In this paper, we propose DQI, a platform-level solution of Data-Quality Improvement designed to assure service dependability for Internet-of-Vehicle services. As an example, DQI is deployed in CarStream, an industrial system of big data processing designed for chauffeured car services. Via CarStream, over 30,000 vehicles are organized in a virtual vehicle network by sharing vehicle-status data in a near real-time manner. Such data often have low-quality issues and compromise the dependability of data-centric services. DQI includes techniques of data-quality improvement, including detecting outliers, extracting frequent patterns, and interpolating sequences. DQI enhances the dependability of data-centric services in IoVs by addressing the common data-quality requirements at the platform level. Upper-level services can benefit from DQI for data-quality improvement and reduce the complexity of service logic. We evaluate DQI by using a three-year dataset of vehicles and real applications deployed in CarStream. The result shows that compared with existing approaches, DQI can effectively restore missing data and correct anomalies with more than 30.0% improvement in precision. By studying multiple real applications, we also show that this data-quality improvement can indeed enhance the dependability of IoV services.},

Selecting a subset of high accurate and consistent data sources and ordering them appropriately is critical to obtain as many high-quality answers as possible right after querying few data sources. However, the process of selecting and ordering data sources can be quite complicated and can present several challenges. The main challenge faced during that process is identifying the most adequate data quality factors to consider. In this paper, we present HASSO, a Highly-Automated Source Selection and Ordering System based on data quality factors. To produce consistent and high accurate answers, HASSO identifies, for each data source, its domain, data consistency and data accuracy using the schema matches. To maximize the total number of complete and non-redundant answers returned right after querying a small number of data sources, HASSO orders data sources in terms of their data overlap and in a decreasing order of their overall coverage. Experimental results in real-world domains show that HASSO produces high-quality answers at high speed.},

abstract = {Organizations have understood the value of their structured data — mostly financial transactions — since the first mainframes were developed in the 40's. Data quality issues have always been a challenge and the increasing numbers of applications consuming and producing structured transactional data has grown exponentially. Unstructured information has been given less significance and strategic importance and therefore fewer resources and less attention on the part of leadership. All of that has changed and is changing faster than anyone imagined. Unstructured content is what humans produce. They create the documents: strategies, proposals, support documents, marketing content, white papers, engineering specifications, etc. that form the intelligence and core knowledge capital of the enterprise. Many organizations have left business units to fend for themselves and “go figure it out” with little guidance or support. These has led to terabytes of content that people cannot find their way through and that leaves the organization open to risks, liabilities and costs of e discovery. According to the Minnesota Journal of Law, Science & Technology, a gig of data costs $30,000 in e discovery costs. The cost of storage is ten cents. The problem is that the enterprise does not understand the hidden costs of not making data accessible and usable — lost time, lost IP, inefficiency, poor customer service that can lead to lost customers, slower growth, etc. As newer collaboration technologies are deployed, they expose the bad habits and sins of the past. Deploying a new search engine shows that the content is not curated. Standing up a new content management application like SharePoint reveals the haphazard shanty town of an information architecture with inconsistencies in models, terminology and applications. Today's landscape of marketing and customer experience technologies is complex and interconnected and requires those upstream knowledge processes that produce unstructured content as the fuel. Customer experience entails everything that happens before you purchase (marketing, education and outreach), when you purchase (e commerce with product content and data), and after you purchase (self-service systems and knowledge bases that support the call center). This is the customer lifecycle and at each step in the process systems and tools need to be harmonized as they gather information about the users using attribute models that are consistent and that serve the business and the customer. They take content and data as input and then output more data. One applications exhaust is another applications fuel. Organizations are also purchasing data streams to enrich their internal information sources. Social media is an enormous virtually untapped reservoir of data about customers and what they think about organizations. This can be mined for sentiment and to gauge marketing effectiveness. Increasingly, much of this is being placed into the hands of the marketing organization. In fact, a study by Gartner Group said that by 2017 the CMO will spend more money on IT than the CIO. What all of this means is that information, content and data governance need to be considered as part of a whole and not as separate initiatives. Elements of good information governance include: • Deployment and Operationalization • Alignment with User Needs • Business Value • Buy-In and Change Management • Sponsorship and Accountability Leads to the following outcomes: • Manages conflicts in business priorities (between initiatives, business units, drivers, etc) • Allows for ongoing input from various stakeholders and constituencies in order to evolve capabilities with the needs of the business • Prioritizes efforts and allocation of resources • Assigns roles and responsibilities with accountability to critical functions • Takes into consideration various levels of maturity in the organization — no one size fits all • Ensures that investments in systems, processes and tools are providing sufficient return to the business • Balances centralized standards with decentralized decision making • Aligns incentives to use a system with business goals This session will review governance concepts, discuss how they apply to various types of data and content and provide a framework for developing governance processes and structures.},

abstract = {Efforts on Big Data technologies have been highly directed towards the amount of data a task can access or crunch. Yet, for content-driven decision making, it is not (only) about the size, but about the "right" data: The number of available datasets (a different type of volume) can reach astronomical sizes, making a thorough evaluation of each input prohibitively expensive. The problem is exacerbated as data sources regularly exhibit varying levels of uncertainty and velocity/churn. To date, there exists no efficient method to quantify the impact of numerous available datasets over different analytics tasks and workflows. This visionary work puts the spotlight on data content rather than size. It proposes a novel modeling, planning and processing research bundle that assesses data quality in terms of analytics performance. The main expected outcome is to provide efficient, continuous and intelligent management and execution of content-driven data analytics. Intelligent dataset selection can achieve massive gains on both accuracy and time required to reach a desired level of performance. This work introduces the notion of utilizing dataset similarity to infer operator behavior and, consequently, be able to build scalable, operator-agnostic performance models for Big Data tasks over different domains. We present an overview of the promising results from our initial work with numerical and graph data and respective operators. We then describe a reference architecture with specific areas of research that need to be tackled in order to provide a data-centric analytics ecosystem.},

abstract = {In the globalized knowledge economy, big data analytics have been widely applied in diverse areas. A critical issue in big data analysis on personal information is the possible leak of personal privacy. Therefore, it is necessary to have an anonymization-based de-identification method to avoid undesirable privacy leak. Such method can prevent published data form being traced back to personal privacy. Prior empirical researches have provided approaches to reduce privacy leak risk, e.g. Maximum Distance to Average Vector (MDAV), Condensation Approach and Differential Privacy. However, previous methods inevitably generate synthetic data of different sizes and is thus unsuitable for general use. To satisfy the need of general use, k-anonymity can be chosen as a privacy protection mechanism in the de-identification process to ensure the data not to be distorted, because k-anonymity is strong in both protecting privacy and preserving data authenticity. Accordingly, this study proposes an optimized multidimensional method for anonymizing data based on both the priority weight-adjusted method and the mean difference recommending tree method (MDR tree method). The results of this study reveal that this new method generate more reliable anonymous data and reduce the information loss rate.},

abstract = {When developing multivariate data classification and clustering methodologies for data mining, it is clear that most literature contributions only really consider data that contain consistently the same attributes. There are however many cases in current big data analytics applications where for same topic and even same source data sets there are differing attributes being measured, for a multitude of reasons (whether the specific design of an experiment or poor data quality and consistency). We define this class of data a dimensionally inconsistent multivariate data, a topic that can be considered a subclass of the Big Data Variety research. This paper explores some classification methodologies commonly used in multivariate classification and clustering tasks and considers how these traditional methodologies could be adapted to compare dimensionally inconsistent data sets. The study focuses on adapting two similarity measures: Robinson-Foulds tree distance metrics and Variation of Information; for comparing clustering of hierarchical cluster algorithms (such clusters are derived from the raw multivariate data). The results from experiments on engineering data highlight that adapting pairwise measures to exclude non-common attributes from the traditional distance metrics may not be the best method of classification. We suggest that more specialised metrics of similarity are required to address challenges presented by dimensionally inconsistent multivariate data, with specific applications for big engineering data analytics.},

abstract = {High-quality data are the prerequisite for analyzing and using big data to guarantee the value of the data. Missing values in data is a common yet challenging problem in data analytics and data mining, especially in the era of big data. Amount of missing values directly affects the data quality. Therefore, it is critical to properly recover missing values in the dataset. This paper presents a new imputation algorithm called Cluster-based Best Match Scanning (CBMS) designed for Big Data. It is a modification of k-NN imputation. CBMS focuses on recovering continuous numeric missing values, and aims at balancing computational complexity and accuracy. As an imputation algorithm, it can potentially reduce the time complexity of k-NN from O(n^2*d) to O(n^1.5*d), and also reduce the space/memory usage, while perform no worse than k-NN imputation. On top of that CBMS is highly parallelizable.Simulation of CBMS is conducted on smart meter reading data. Data is manually divided into training set and testing set, and testing accuracy is evaluated by computing the mean absolute deviation. Comparison with linear interpolation and k-NN imputation is made to demonstrate the power and effectiveness of our proposed CBMS algorithm.},

abstract = {Retrospective data harmonization across multiple research cohorts and studies is frequently done to increase statistical power, provide comparison analysis, and create a richer data source for data mining. However, when combining disparate data sources, harmonization projects face data management and analysis challenges. These include differences in the data dictionaries and variable definitions, privacy concerns surrounding health data representing sensitive populations, and lack of properly defined data models. With the availability of mature open-source web-based database technologies, developing a complete software architecture to overcome the challenges associated with the harmonization process can alleviate many roadblocks. By leveraging state-of-the-art software engineering and database principles, we can ensure data quality and enable cross-center online access and collaboration.This paper outlines a complete software architecture developed and customized using the Django web framework, leveraged to harmonize sensitive data collected from three NIH-support birth cohorts. We describe our framework and show how we successfully overcame challenges faced when harmonizing data from these cohorts. We discuss our efforts in data cleaning, data sharing, data transformation, data visualization, and analytics, while reflecting on what we have learned to date from these harmonized datasets.},

abstract = {Many organizations process big data for important business operations and decisions. Hence, data quality greatly affects their success. Data quality problems continue to be widespread, costing US businesses an estimated $600 billion annually. To date, addressing data quality in production environments still poses many challenges: easily defining properties of high-quality data; validating production-scale data in a timely manner; debugging poor quality data; designing data quality solutions to be easy to use, understand, and operate; and designing data quality solutions to easily integrate with other systems. Current data validation solutions do not comprehensively address these challenges. To address data quality in production environments at LinkedIn, we developed Data Sentinel, a declarative production-scale data validation platform. In a simple and well-structured configuration, users declaratively specify the desired data checks. Then, Data Sentinel performs these data checks and writes the results to an easily understandable report. Furthermore, Data Sentinel provides well-defined schemas for the configuration and report. This makes it easy for other systems to interface or integrate with Data Sentinel. To make Data Sentinel even easier to use, understand, and operate in production environments, we provide Data Sentinel Service (DSS), a complementary system to help specify data checks, schedule, deploy, and tune data validation jobs, and understand data checking results. The contributions of this paper include the following: 1) Data Sentinel, a declarative production-scale data validation platform successfully deployed at LinkedIn 2) A generic design to build and deploy similar systems for production environments 3) Experiences and lessons learned that can benefit practitioners with similar objectives.},

abstract = {Sensor data whether collected for machine learning, deep learning or other applications must be preprocessed to fit input requirements or improve performance and accuracy. Data preparation is an expensive, resource consuming and complex phase often performed centrally on raw data for a specific application. The dataflow between the edge and the cloud can be enhanced in terms of efficiency, reliability and lineage by preprocessing the datasets closer to their data sources. We propose a dedicated data preprocessing framework that distributes preprocessing tasks between a cloud stage and two edge stages to create a dataflow with progressively improving quality. The framework handles heterogenous data and dynamic preprocessing plans simultaneously targeting diverse applications and use cases from different domains. Each stage autonomously executes sensor specific preprocessing plans in parallel while synchronizing the progressive execution and dynamic updates of the preprocessing plans with the other stages. Our approach minimizes the workload on central infrastructures and reduces the resources used for transferring raw data from the edge. We also demonstrate that preprocessing data can be sensor specific rather than application specific and thus can be performed prior to knowing a specific application.},

We propose a new Data Cleaning-as-a-Service model that allows a client to interact with a data cleaning provider who hosts curated, and sensitive data. We present PACAS: a Privacy-Aware data Cleaning-As-a-Service framework that facilitates communication between the client and the service provider via a data pricing scheme where clients issue queries, and the service provider returns clean answers for a price while protecting her data. We propose a practical privacy model in such interactive settings called (X,Y,L)-anonymity that extends existing data publishing techniques to consider the data semantics while protecting sensitive values. Our evaluation over real data shows that PACAS effectively safeguards semantically related sensitive values, and provides improved accuracy over existing privacy-aware cleaning techniques.},

abstract = {The multimedia transmission represents a typical big data application in the fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks. However, supporting multimedia big data transmission over 5G wireless networks imposes many new and open challenges because multimedia big data services are both time-sensitive and bandwidth-intensive over time-varying wireless channels with constrained wireless resources. To overcome these difficulties, in this paper we propose the information-centric virtualization architectures for software-defined statistical delay-bounded quality of service (QoS) provisioning over 5G multimedia big data wireless networks. In particular, our proposed schemes integrate the three 5G-promising candidate techniques to guarantee the statistical delay-bounded QoS for multimedia big data transmissions: 1) information-centric network (ICN), to derive the optimal in-network caching locations for multimedia big data; 2) network functions virtualization (NFV), to abstract the PHY-layer infrastructures into several virtualized networks to derive the optimal multimedia data contents delivery paths; and 3) software-defined networks (SDNs), to dynamically reconfigure wireless resources allocation architectures through the SDN-control plane. Under our proposed architectures, to jointly optimize the implementations of NFV and SDN techniques under ICN architectures, we develop the three virtual network selection and transmit-power allocation schemes to: 1) maximize single user's effective capacity; 2) jointly optimize the aggregate effective capacity and allocation fairness over all users; and 3) coordinate non-cooperative gaming among all users, respectively. By simulations and numerical analyses, we show that our proposed architectures and schemes significantly outperform the other existing schemes in supporting the statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning over the 5G multimedia big data wireless networks.},

In this paper, we propose inconsistency detection algorithms in terms of FD, CFD, and Denial Constraint (DC). DCs are more expressive than FDs and CFDs. Developing the algorithm to detect the violation of DCs increases the applicability of our inconsistency detection algorithms. We compare the performance of our algorithm with the performance of implementing SQL queries in MySQL and BigQuery. The experimental results indicate the high efficiency of our algorithms.},

abstract = {Data quality significantly impacts the results of data analytics. Researchers have proposed machine learning based anomaly detection techniques to identify incorrect data. Existing approaches fail to (1) identify the underlying domain constraints violated by the anomalous data, and (2) generate explanations of these violations in a form comprehensible to domain experts. We propose IDEAL, which is an LSTM-Autoencoder based approach that detects anomalies in multivariate time-series data, generates domain constraints, and reports subsequences that violate the constraints as anomalies. We propose an automated autocorrelation-based windowing approach to adjust the network input size, thereby improving the correctness and performance of constraint discovery over manual and brute-force approaches. The anomalies are visualized in a manner comprehensible to domain experts in the form of decision trees extracted from a random forest classifier. Domain experts can then provide feedback to retrain the learning model and improve the accuracy of the process. We evaluate the effectiveness of IDEAL using datasets from Yahoo servers, NASA Shuttle, and Colorado State University Energy Institute. We demonstrate that IDEAL can detect previously known anomalies from these datasets. Using mutation analysis, we show that IDEAL can detect different types of injected faults. We also demonstrate that the accuracy improves after incorporating domain expert feedback.},

Such continuous massive growth of structured and unstructured data is referred to as a “Big data”. The processing and storage of big data through a conventional technique is not possible. Due to improved proficiency of Big Data solution in handling data, such as NoSQL caused the developers in the previous decade to start preferring big data databases, such as Apache Cassandra, Oracle, and NoSQL. NoSQL is a modern database technology that is designed to provide scalability to support voluminous data, leading to the rise of NoSQL as the most viable database solution. These modern databases aim to overcome the limitations of relational databases such as unlimited scalability, high performance, data modeling, data distribution, and continuous availability. These days, the larger enterprises need to shift NoSQL databases due to their more flexible models. It is a great challenge for business organizations and enterprises to transform their existing databases to NoSQL databases considering heterogeneity and complexity in relational data. In addition, with the emergence of big data, data cleansing has become a great challenge. In this paper, we proposed an approach that has two modules: data transformation and data cleansing module. The first phase is the transformation of a relational database to Oracle NoSQL database through model transformation. The second phase provides data cleansing ability to improve data quality and prepare it for big data analytics. The experiments show the proposed approach successfully transforms the relational database to a big data database and improve data quality.},

We then employ PSO algorithm with MapReduce mechanism to achieve a fine-grained evaluation of indicator for service identification. Based on the integration, candidate services which can better meet with user requirements will be selected. Finally, we use Beth trust model on the quality of experience of users and set up a monitoring mechanism to better obtain required services. Simulation results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed approach has better performance in service identification compared with other current approaches in big data scenarios.},

abstract = {In this paper, a novel variational inference semisupervised Gaussian mixture model (VI-S2GMM) model is first proposed for semisupervised predictive modeling in multimode processes. Parameters of Gaussian components are identified more accurately with extra unlabeled samples, which improve the prediction performance of the regression model. Since all labeled and unlabeled data samples are involved in each iteration of parameter updating, intractable computing problems occur when facing high-dimension datasets. To tackle this problem, a scalable stochastic VI-S2GMM (SVI-S2GMM) is further proposed. Through taking advantage of a stochastic gradient optimization algorithm to maximize the evidence of lower bound, the VI-based algorithm becomes scalable. In the SVI-S2GMM, only one or a minibatch of samples is randomly selected to update parameters in each iteration, which is more efficient than the VI-S2GMM. Since the whole dataset is divided and transferred to iterations batch by batch, the scalable SVI-S2GMM algorithm can easily handle the big data modeling issue. In this way, a large number of unlabeled data can be useful in the modeling, which will further benefit the prediction performance. The SVI-S2GMM is then exploited for the prediction of a quality-related key performance index. Two examples demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

The proposed method is aimed to automatically detect anomaly, such as high-frequency vessel noise, Doppler noise, in sperm whale (SPW) sound as well as the quality of the sound. A new signature function derived from a multi-taper spectrogram is able to detect the anomaly in the data and a new anomaly distortion measure can detect the sound quality into good/bad. The proposed method, is tested with 1905 minutes of data spanning a single year, and using a human operator's annotations. The experimental results reveal that the proposed multitaper spectrogram based approach is efficient in detecting anomaly as well as sperm whale sound quality for hydrophone big data and high detection accuracy (>85%) is achieved for raw input hydrophone data.},

abstract = {Data preparation for data mining in industrial applications is a key success factor which requires considerable repeated efforts. Although the required activities need to be repeated in very similar fashion across many projects, details of their implementation differ and require both application understanding and experience. As a result, data preparation is done by data mining experts with a strong domain background and a good understanding of the characteristics of the data to be analyzed. Experts with these profiles usually have an engineering background and no strong expertise in distributed programming or big data technology. Unfortunately, the amount of data can be so large that distributed algorithms are required to allow for inspection of results and iteration of preparation steps. This contribution introduces an interactive data preparation workflow for signal data from chemical plants enabling domain experts without background in distributed computing and extensive programming experience to leverage the power of big data technologies.},

abstract = {Besides the conventional schema-oriented tasks, data dependencies are recently revisited for data quality applications, such as violation detection. To address the variety and veracity issues of big data, data dependencies have been extended as data quality rules to adapt to various data types, ranging from (1)categorical data with equality relationships to (2)heterogeneous data with similarity relationships, and (3)numerical data with order relationships. In this survey, we briefly review the recent proposals on data dependencies categorized into the aforesaid types of data. In addition to (a)the concepts of these data dependency notations, we investigate (b)the extension relationships between data dependencies, e.g., conditional functional dependencies (CFDs) extend the conventional functional dependencies (FDs). It forms a family tree of extensions, mostly rooted in FDs, helping us understand the expressive power of various data dependencies. Moreover, we summarize (c)the discovery of dependencies from data, since data dependencies are often unlikely to be manually specified in a traditional way, given the huge volume and high variety of big data. We further outline (d)the applications of the extended data dependencies, in particular in data quality practice. It guides users to select proper data dependencies with sufficient expressive power and reasonable discovery cost. Finally, we conclude with several directions of future studies on the emerging data.},

abstract = {Here a work in progress is reported on within research that aims to obtain knowledge about variables which may influence a hospital emergency department's performance and quality of service. Knowledge discovery will be achieved through the analysis of intensive data generated by the simulation of any possible scenario in the real system. The challenge is to provide knowledge of critical, non-usual or extreme situations. Simulation is the only way to obtain information about these kinds of situations, as it is not possible to test such scenarios in the real system. We show how simulation of the real system through advanced computing is a source of big data, as it allows rapid and massive data generation. The potential of high performance computing makes it possible to generate a very large amount of data within a reasonable time, store this data, then process and analyze it to obtain knowledge. We describe the methodology proposed for this goal, which is based on the use of the simulator as a sensor of the real system, and so as the main source of data. The application of data mining techniques will open the doors to knowledge. To verify that the proposed methodology works, we propose a case study in which the aim is to obtain knowledge from a set of data already available, obtained from the simulation of a reduced set of scenarios of the real system.},

The discovery of functional dependencies has a wide range of applications such as database design, knowledge discovery, data quality assessment, etc. There has been growing interest in the problem of functional dependencies discovery in the last ten years. However, existing functional dependencies discovery algorithms are mainly applied to centralized small data. It is far more challenging to discover functional dependencies from big data. In this paper, we propose an efficient functional dependencies discovery algorithm, for mining functional dependencies from distributed big data. We prune candidate FDs at each node by local fragmented data and batch verify candidate FDs in parallel. Load balance is taken into account when discovering functional dependencies. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is effective on real dataset and synthetic dataset.},

Accuracy and response time, being the most important quality concerns for BDCA, are impacted by changes in security events data. Whilst it is promising to adapt a BDCA system's architecture to the changes in security events data for optimizing accuracy and response time, it is important to consider large search space of architectural configurations. Searching a large space of configurations for potential adaptation incurs an overwhelming adaptation time, which may cancel the benefits of adaptation. We present an adaptation approach, QuickAdapt, to enable quick adaptation of a BDCA system. QuickAdapt uses descriptive statistics (e.g., mean and variance) of security events data and fuzzy rules to (re) compose a system with a set of components to ensure optimal accuracy and response time. We have evaluated QuickAdapt for a distributed BDCA system using four datasets. Our evaluation shows that on average QuickAdapt reduces adaptation time by 105× with a competitive adaptation accuracy of 70% as compared to an existing solution.},

abstract = {In the era of data science and big data analytics, people analytics help organizations and their human resources (HR) managers to reduce attrition by changing the way of attracting and retaining talent. In this context, employee attrition presents a critical problem and a big risk for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. In this context, the salient contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, we propose a people analytics approach to predict employee attrition that shifts from a big data to a deep data context by focusing on data quality instead of its quantity. In fact, this deep data-driven approach is based on a mixed method to construct a relevant employee attrition model in order to identify key employee features influencing his/her attrition. In this method, we started thinking `big' by collecting most of the common features from the literature (an exploratory research) then we tried thinking `deep' by filtering and selecting the most important features using survey and feature selection algorithms (a quantitative method). Secondly, this attrition prediction approach is based on machine, deep and ensemble learning models and is experimented on a large-sized and a medium-sized simulated human resources datasets and then a real small-sized dataset from a total of 450 responses. Our approach achieves higher accuracy (0.96, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively) for the three datasets when compared previous solutions. Finally, while rewards and payments are generally considered as the most important keys to retention, our findings indicate that `business travel', which is less common in the literature, is the leading motivator for employees and must be considered within HR policies to retention.},

Then, it uses data mining techniques to generate attributes constituting an MD.

abstract = {Summary form only given. At present, it is projected that about 4 zettabytes (or 10**21 bytes) of electronic data are being generated per year by everything from underground physics experiments to retail transactions to security cameras to global positioning systems. In the U. S., major research programs are being funded to deal with big data in all five economic sectors (i.e., services, manufacturing, construction, agriculture and mining) of the economy. Big Data is a term applied to data sets whose size is beyond the ability of available tools to undertake their acquisition, access, analytics and/or application in a reasonable amount of time. Whereas Tien (2003) forewarned about the data rich, information poor (DRIP) problems that have been pervasive since the advent of large-scale data collections or warehouses, the DRIP conundrum has been somewhat mitigated by the Big Data approach which has unleashed information in a manner that can support informed - yet, not necessarily defensible or knowledgeable - decisions or choices. Thus, by somewhat overcoming data quality issues with data quantity, data access restrictions with on-demand cloud computing, causative analysis with correlative data analytics, and model-driven with evidence-driven applications, appropriate actions can be undertaken with the obtained information. New acquisition, access, analytics and application technologies are being developed to further Big Data as it is being employed to help resolve the 14 grand challenges (identified by the National Academy of Engineering in 2008), underpin the 10 breakthrough technologies (compiled by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2013) and support the Third Industrial Revolution of mass customization.},

abstract = {Privacy is an issue of concern in the electronic era where data has become a primary source of investment for businesses and organizations. The value generated from data is put to use in a number of ways for economic benefit. Customer profiling is one such instance, where data collected is used for targeted marketing, personalized purchase recommendations and customized product deliveries. In such applications, the risk of individual sensitive information disclosure always prevails, affecting the privacy of individuals involved. Hence privacy preserving analysis demands suppressing or transforming data before it is published for analysis, thus curbing data leak. Subsequently, data quality degrades, and operative analytics is affected. With Big data, algorithms that offer a reasonable qualityprivacy trade off need enhancements in terms of efficiency and scalability. In this paper, the work proposed uses a privacy based composite classifier model to analyze the accuracy of classification. The diverse characteristics of algorithms in the composite classifier are found to balance the classification accuracy that is likely to get affected by privacy model. Further, the model's performance with respect to execution time is then evaluated using the parallel computing framework Spark.},

abstract = {Big data techniques has been applied to power grid for the evaluation and prediction of grid conditions. However, the raw data quality rarely can meet the requirement of precise data analytics since raw data set usually contains samples with missing data to which the common data mining models are sensitive. Though classic interpolation or neural network methods can been used to fill the gaps of missing data, their predicted data often fail to fit the rules of power grid conditions. This paper presents a machine learning framework (OR_MLF) to improve the prediction accuracy for datasets with missing data points, which mainly combines preprocessing, optimizing support vector machine (OSVM) and refining SVM (RSVM). On top of the OSVM engine, the scheme introduces dedicated data training strategies. First, the original data originating from data generation facilities is preprocessed through standardization. Traditional SVM is then trained to obtain a preliminary prediction model. Next, the optimized SVM predictors are achieved with new training data set, which is extracted based on the preliminary prediction model. Finally, the missing data prediction result depending on OSVM is selectively inputted into the traditional SVM and the refined SVM is lastly accomplished. We test the OR_MLF framework on missing data prediction of power transformers in power grid system. The experimental results show that the predictors based on the proposed framework achieve lower mean square error than traditional ones. Therefore, the framework OR_MLF would be a good candidate to predict the missing data in power grid system.},

abstract = {Thesauri are knowledge systems which may ease Big Data access, fostering their integration and re-use. Currently several Linked Data thesauri covering multi-disciplines are available. They provide a semantic foundation to effectively support cross-organization and cross-disciplinary management and usage of Big Data. Thesauri effectiveness is affected by their quality. Diverse quality measures are available taking into account different facets. However, an overall measure is needed to compare several thesauri and to identify those more qualified for a proper reuse. In this paper, we propose a Multi Criteria Decision Making based methodology for the documentation of the quality assessment of linked thesauri as a whole. We present a proof of concept of the Analytic Hierarchy Process adoption to the set of Linked Data thesauri for the Environment deployed in LusTRE. We discuss the step-by-step practice to document the overall quality measurements, generated by the quality assessment, with the W3C promoted Data Quality Vocabulary.},

abstract = {As the core of informatization, data has a huge significance to the development of information-based enterprises. Data replication technology is an important approach to solve the problem of enterprise data sharing based on distributed database system. It plays a crucial role in promoting business integration of enterprises and institutions, improving data quality, enhancing data sharing and improving the application level of back-end big data analysis [1]. It is necessary to do research for making a good data management of the distributed database application system, synchronizing the data to the data, preventing data conflicting and being able to synchronize or asynchronous replication. Combining with the database design model of the ship monitoring and control system, this paper mainly described how to complete the construction of distributed database system using Oracle, based on advanced replication technology named as the combination of multi-agent replication and materialized views hybrid replication technology.},

abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm gains popularity, the next few years will likely witness 'servitization' of domain sensing functionalities. We envision a cloud-based eco-system in which high quality data from large numbers of independently-managed sensors is shared or even traded in real-time. Such an eco-system will necessarily have multiple stakeholders such as sensor data providers, domain applications that utilize sensor data (data consumers), and cloud infrastructure providers who may collaborate as well as compete. While there has been considerable research on wireless sensor networks, the challenges involved in building cloud-based platforms for hosting sensor services are largely unexplored. In this paper, we present our vision for data quality (DQ)-centric big data infrastructure for federated sensor service clouds. We first motivate our work by providing real-world examples. We outline the key features that federated sensor service clouds need to possess. This paper proposes a big data architecture in which DQ is pervasive throughout the platform. Our architecture includes a markup language called SDQ-ML for describing sensor services as well as for domain applications to express their sensor feed requirements. The paper explores the advantages and limitations of current big data technologies in building various components of the platform. We also outline our initial ideas towards addressing the limitations.},

abstract = {Because of the increasing volume of autonomously collected data objects, duplicate detection is an important challenge in today's data management. To evaluate the efficiency of duplicate detection algorithms with respect to big data, large test data sets are required. Existing test data generation tools, however, are either not able to produce large test data sets or are domain-dependent which limits their usefulness to a few cases. In this paper, we describe a new framework that can be used to pollute a clean, homogeneous and large data set from an arbitrary domain with duplicates, errors and inhomogeneities. To prove its concept, we implemented a prototype which is built upon the cluster computing framework Apache Spark and evaluate its performance in several experiments.},

abstract = {During recent years, we observe a widespread of new data sources, especially all types of social media and IoT devices, which produce huge data volumes, whose content ranges from fully structured to totally unstructured. All these types of data are commonly referred to as big data. They are typically described by the three most important characteristics, called 3V [1], namely: an extremely large volume, a variety of data models and structures (data representations), as well as a high velocity at which data are generated. We argue that out of these three Vs, the most challenging is variety [2]. Such data need to be integrated and transformed into a common representation, which is suitable for analysis, in a similar manner as traditional (mainly table-like) data.},

abstract = {Data analysis is a demanding task that involves extracting deep insights hidden in data. Many businesses enforce data analysis irrespective of the domain, as it is crucial in minimizing developmental risks. Raw data cannot be used to perform any analysis as poor-quality data leads to erroneous decision-making. This makes data quality assessment a necessary function before data analysis. Data quality is a multi-dimensional factor that affects the analysis in multiple ways. Among all the dimensions, consistency is one of the most critical dimensions to assess. Context of data plays an important role in consistency assessment, as the records are inherently related within a dataset. Existing studies are computationally expensive and do not consider the context of data. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive context-aware data consistency assessment tool that uses machine learning to evaluate the consistency of data. Our model was developed on Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark to support big data, as well as to boost some computationally intensive algorithms.},

People gradually realize that judicial data contains tremendous social and business value. However, we need stronger ability to handle with and apply massive, multi-source and heterogeneous judicial data. A complete data governance system should be built in order to make full use of the value of data assets. In such a data governance system, data quality control is one of the key steps of data governance, and also the bottleneck of data service development, because data quality determines the upper limit of data application. This paper proposes a judicial data quality measurement framework by analyzing some judicial business data, followed by a data governance method driven by it.},

abstract = {Web Services play a vital role in e-commerce and e-business applications. A WS (Web Service) application is interoperable and can work on any platform i.e.; platform independent, large scale distributed systems can be established easily. A Recommender System is a precious tool for providing appropriate recommendations to all users in a Hotel Reservation Website. User based, Top k and profile based approaches are used in collaborative filtering algorithm which does not provide personalized results to the users and inefficiency and scalability problem also occurs due to the increase in the size of large datasets. To address the above mentioned challenges, a Valence-Arousal Similarity based Recommendation Services, called VAS based RS, is proposed. Our proposed mechanism aims to presents a personalized service recommendation list and recommending the most suitable service to the end users. Moreover, it classifies the positive and negative preferences of the users from their reviews to improve the prediction accuracy. For improve its efficiency and scalability in big data environment, VAS based RS is implemented using collaborative filtering algorithm on MapReduce parallel processing paradigm in Hadoop, a widely-adopted distributed computing platform.},
