abstract = {Proliferation of sensors embedded in smartphones and smartwatches helps capture rich dataset for machine learning algorithms to extract meaningful digital bio-markers on consumer devices for monitoring disease progression and treatment response. However, development and validation of machine learning algorithms depend on gathering high fidelity sensor data and reliable ground-truth. We conduct a study, called mLungStudy, with 131 subjects with varying pulmonary conditions to collect mobile sensor data including audio, accelerometer, gyroscope using a smartphone and a smartwatch, in order to extract pulmonary biomarkers such as breathing, coughs, spirometry, and breathlessness. Our study shows that commonly used breathing ground-truth data from chestband may not always be reliable as a gold-standard. Our analysis shows that breathlessness biomarkers such as pause time and pause frequency from 2.15 minutes of audio can be as reliable as those extracted from 5 minutes' worth of speech data. This finding can be useful for future studies to trade-off between the reliability of breathlessness data and patient comfort in generating continuous speech data. Furthermore, we use crowdsourcing techniques to annotate pulmonary sound events for developing signal processing and machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we highlight several practical challenges to collect and annotate physiological data and acoustic symptoms from chronic pulmonary patients and ways to improve data quality. We show that the waveform visualization of the audio signal improves annotation quality which leads to a 6.59% increase in cough classification accuracy and a 6% increase in spirometry event classification accuracy. Findings from this study inform future studies focusing on developing explainable machine learning models to extract pulmonary digital bio-markers using mobile sensors.},

abstract = {Geographic Information System (GIS) is a computer system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of spatial data. Spatial data, whether captured through remote sensors or large scale simulations becomes more and big and heterogenous. As a result, structured data and unstructured content are simultaneously accessed via an integrated user interface. The issue of real-time and heterogeneity is extremely important for taking effective decision. Thus, heterogeneous real-time spatial data management is a very active research domain nowadays. Existing research are interested in querying of real-time spatial data and their updates without taking into account the heterogeneity of real-time geospatial data. In this paper, we propose the use of the real-time Spatial Big Data and we define a new architecture called FCSA-RTSBD (Feedback Control Scheduling Architecture for Real-Time Spatial Big Data). The main objectives of this architecture are the following: take in account the heterogeneity of data, guarantee the data freshness, enhance the deadline miss ratio even in the presence of conflicts and finally satisfy the requirements of users by the improving of the quality of service (QoS).},

abstract = {For the last two decades, data driven cities have emerged as an efficient way of improving the city performance, enhancing life quality, and providing more choices to city planners and decision makers. A significant change in data driven cities in recent years is that much more data are collected from a variety of sources and can be processed into various forms for different stakeholders. The availability of a large amount of data can potentially lead to a revolution in city development, changing the city operation system from a conventional technology-driven system into a more powerful multifunctional data-driven intelligent system. But with more data collected the more questions raised about the optimization and space saving methods, then the quality of data collected and the efficiency of the its treatment. In this paper, we provide a survey on the data driven cities requirements, and the tools made available for the responsive cities to maintain its data.},

abstract = { Recently, graph collaborative filtering methods have been proposed as an effective recommendation approach, which can capture users’ preference over items by modeling the user-item interaction graphs. Despite the effectiveness, these methods suffer from data sparsity in real scenarios. In order to reduce the influence of data sparsity, contrastive learning is adopted in graph collaborative filtering for enhancing the performance. However, these methods typically construct the contrastive pairs by random sampling, which neglect the neighboring relations among users&nbsp;(or items) and fail to fully exploit the potential of contrastive learning for recommendation. To tackle the above issue, we propose a novel contrastive learning approach, named Neighborhood-enriched Contrastive Learning, named NCL, which explicitly incorporates the potential neighbors into contrastive pairs. Specifically, we introduce the neighbors of a user&nbsp;(or an item) from graph structure and semantic space respectively. For the structural neighbors on the interaction graph, we develop a novel structure-contrastive objective that regards users&nbsp;(or items) and their structural neighbors as positive contrastive pairs. In implementation, the representations of users&nbsp;(or items) and neighbors correspond to the outputs of different GNN layers. Furthermore, to excavate the potential neighbor relation in semantic space, we assume that users with similar representations are within the semantic neighborhood, and incorporate these semantic neighbors into the prototype-contrastive objective. The proposed NCL can be optimized with EM algorithm and generalized to apply to graph collaborative filtering methods. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NCL, notably with 26% and 17% performance gain over a competitive graph collaborative filtering base model on the Yelp and Amazon-book datasets, respectively. Our implementation code is available at: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/NCL.},

Its intention is to provide a personalized solution to any individual health problem. Nevertheless, three main issues must be considered to make Precision Medicine a reality: i) the understanding of the huge amount of genomic data, spread out in hundreds of genome data sources, with different formats and contents, whose semantic interoperability is a must; ii) the development of information systems intended to guide the search of relevant genomic repositories related with a disease, the identification of significant information for its prevention, diagnosis and/or treatment and its management in an efficient software platform; iii) the high variability in the quality of the publicly available information. This paper presents a conceptual framework for solving these problems by i) using a precise conceptual schema of the human genome, and ii) introducing a method to search, identify, load and adequately interpret the required data, assuring its quality during the entire process.},

abstract = {We are witnessing a rapid growth of electrified vehicles due to the ever-increasing concerns on urban air quality and energy security. Compared to other types of electric vehicles, electric buses have not yet been prevailingly adopted worldwide due to their high owning and operating costs, long charging time, and the uneven spatial distribution of charging facilities. Moreover, the highly dynamic environment factors such as unpredictable traffic congestion, different passenger demands, and even the changing weather can significantly affect electric bus charging efficiency and potentially hinder the further promotion of large-scale electric bus fleets. To address these issues, in this article, we first analyze a real-world dataset including massive data from 16,359 electric buses, 1,400 bus lines, and 5,562 bus stops. Then, we investigate the electric bus network to understand its operating and charging patterns, and further verify the necessity and feasibility of a real-time charging scheduling. With such understanding, we design busCharging, a pricing-aware real-time charging scheduling system based on Markov Decision Process to reduce the overall charging and operating costs for city-scale electric bus fleets, taking the time-variant electricity pricing into account. To show the effectiveness of busCharging, we implement it with the real-world data from Shenzhen, which includes GPS data of electric buses, the metadata of all bus lines and bus stops, combined with data of 376 charging stations for electric buses. The evaluation results show that busCharging dramatically reduces the charging cost by 23.7% and 12.8% of electricity usage simultaneously. Finally, we design a scheduling-based charging station expansion strategy to verify our busCharging is also effective during the charging station expansion process.},

abstract = {The massive volumes of data in biological sequence databases provide a remarkable resource for large-scale biological studies. However, the underlying data quality of these resources is a critical concern. A particular challenge is duplication, in which multiple records have similar sequences, creating a high level of redundancy that impacts database storage, curation, and search. Biological database deduplication has two direct applications: for database curation, where detected duplicates are removed to improve curation efficiency, and for database search, where detected duplicate sequences may be flagged but remain available to support analysis.Clustering methods have been widely applied to biological sequences for database deduplication. Since an exhaustive all-by-all pairwise comparison of sequences cannot scale for a high volume of data, heuristic approaches have been recruited, such as the use of simple similarity thresholds. In this article, we present a comparison between CD-HIT and UCLUST, the two best-known clustering tools for sequence database deduplication. Our contributions include a detailed assessment of the redundancy remaining after deduplication, application of standard clustering evaluation metrics to quantify the cohesion and separation of the clusters generated by each method, and a biological case study that assesses intracluster function annotation consistency to demonstrate the impact of these factors on a practical application of the sequence clustering methods. Our results show that the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy becomes acute when low threshold values are used and when cluster sizes are large. This evaluation leads to practical recommendations for users for more effective uses of the sequence clustering tools for deduplication.},

abstract = {Knowledge tracing is a fundamental task in intelligent education for tracking the knowledge states of students on necessary concepts. In recent years, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) utilizes recurrent neural networks to model student learning sequences. This approach has achieved significant success and has been widely used in many educational applications. However, in practical scenarios, it tends to suffer from the following critical problems due to data isolation: 1) Data scarcity. Educational data, which is usually distributed across different silos (e.g., schools), is difficult to gather. 2) Different data quality. Students in different silos have different learning schedules, which results in unbalanced learning records, meaning that it is necessary to evaluate the learning data quality independently for different silos. 3) Data incomparability. It is difficult to compare the knowledge states of students with different learning processes from different silos. Inspired by federated learning, in this paper, we propose a novel Federated Deep Knowledge Tracing (FDKT) framework to collectively train high-quality DKT models for multiple silos. In this framework, each client takes charge of training a distributed DKT model and evaluating data quality by leveraging its own local data, while a center server is responsible for aggregating models and updating the parameters for all the clients. In particular, in the client part, we evaluate data quality incorporating different education measurement theories, and we construct two quality-oriented implementations based on FDKT, i.e., FDKTCTT and FDKTIRT-where the means of data quality evaluation follow Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory, respectively. Moreover, in the server part, we adopt hierarchical model interpolation to uptake local effects for model personalization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the FDKT framework.},

abstract = {Open data is seen as a promising source of new business, especially in the SME sector, in the form of new products, services and innovative solutions. High importance is seen also in fostering citizens' participation in political and social life and increasing the transparency of public authorities. The forerunners of the open data movement in the public sector are the USA and the UK, which started to open their public data resources in 2009. The first European Union open data related directive was drawn up as early as 2003; however progress in putting the idea into practice has been slow and adoptions by the wider member states are placed in the early 2010s. The beneficial use of open data in real applications has progressed hand in hand with the improvement of other ICT-related technologies. The (raw) data itself has no high value. The economic value comes from a balanced combination of high quality open (data) resources combined with the related value chain. This paper builds up a "big picture" of the role of open data in current society. The approach is analytical and it clarifies the topic from the viewpoints of both opportunities and challenges. The paper covers both general aspects related to open data and results of the research and regional development project conducted by the authors.},

abstract = {Demands for production and dissemination of reliable data is growing with increasing demand from public policies to monitor, compare and improve global and national developmental status and targets. Implementation of intentionally agreed commitments like Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Sustainable development Goals (SDGs) are influencing data production and availability, and the development of national statistical capacities. They also trigger challenges and opportunities in production of internationally comparable data to induce fair comparability among nations. Being a signatory to major international treaties, India has considerably improved data production, accessibility and availability over the years to ensure proper alignment of national level statistics and induce international comparison. However, very little efforts have been made to assess India's progress around data production and dissemination around growingly important land governance. This assessment attempts to identify key opportunities and challenges at the country level to improve data availability, access, timeliness and quality.India has made many progressive reforms around land laws and institutions to make land governance more inclusive and equitable; however its assessment with respect to global best practices through World Bank's Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) indicate the need of improvements around different land dimensions. Movement towards good land governance outcomes is incumbent upon robust and regular monitoring mechanism of land indicators across spatial (viz. administrative boundaries, land being a state subject in India) and temporal scales.India has traditions of collecting, maintaining and reporting land information through nation-wide surveys, census, administrative and judicial reports/ databases. Its flagship program Digital India Land Record Modernization Program (DILRMP), has been supporting universal digitization of spatial and textual land records by the states. Together, these administrative and survey-derived datasets provide seamless opportunity for routine generation of data on key land indicators at low cost on a regularbasis. Land is a state subject in India. Monitoring and reporting land-indicators at state levels would help in systematically discovering and identifying good practice that can then be documented and disseminated across states, manage change, and gradually move towards a more performance-based approach to improving land governance in India. However, there have been lack of institutionalized attempts, so far, to report land-indicators at national scale.We have tried to assess the state of data in India, particularly to track and report two critical land governance indicators viz. women land rights and forest rights, critical to ensure equity and sustainability in terms of public policy. With UN's SDG, defining similar indicators, we also attempt aligning them around SDG indicators. Status of these two parameters were analyzed using nation-wide datasets collecting whole population data, through legitimate institutions following robust processes and reporting them open access.Census (human population) data and Forest Survey of India (FSI) data were used to assess village-wise forest areas eligible for recognition of rights under India's historic Forest Rights Act, 2005. Using the FSI data and meta-analysis of census data, we calculated the estimated population (150 million including 90 million tribal) living in villages that have forest land within administrative revenue boundaries, potential area (40 million ha) that can be recognized under FRA and number of villages (0.17 million) that are eligible to initiate the claim. These data were made available across administrative boundaries of state, district and village, providing opportunities for relevant Government Ministries at Central and State level and civil society to expedite the forest rights recognition under India's largest land reform process.In order to assess women's land rights (WLR) in India in the context of the SDGs, after examining the existing data sets, we used Agricultural Census data, conducted by Government of India every fifth year following the guidelines of World Census on Agriculture (WCA). Using Agricultural census data, we have developed atlas of women land rights (based on operational holdings) in India with state and district wise granularity with further disaggregation across ethnicity (caste) and other socio-economic parameters. The study also attempted to analyze the link between the inter-regional and temporal variability of WLR and relevant policies and legal-institutional frameworks among the states to see if the correlations can better inform public policy and also induce healthy competition among states to appreciate and follow best practices. This paper presents the process, methodology and results of the data-analysis for these two land indicators while delving into the scope and challenges of dealing with existing and upcoming big datasets in India to report the land governance indicators and the potential policy spinoffs.},

abstract = {In recent years, the prevalence of diabetes has been increasing rapidly worldwide. With the advancement of information technology, automated question-answering services for healthcare, which are commonly based on annotated corpus in health domain, have positive effects on health knowledge spread and daily health management for high-risk populations. This paper proposes to construct a large scale diabetes corpus of frequently-asked questions for automated question-answering services and evaluations. Concentrating on the characteristics of diabetes-related factors that reflect conditions of diabetes, this work establishes an annotated dataset containing professional question &amp; answer pairs about diabetes and their annotated question target categories. The corpus is applicable for various question-answering applications, supporting users to retrieve needed information, arrange diets, adhere to scientific medication as well as prevent and control disease complications.},

abstract = { AI models are increasingly applied in high-stakes domains like health and conservation. Data quality carries an elevated significance in high-stakes AI due to its heightened downstream impact, impacting predictions like cancer detection, wildlife poaching, and loan allocations. Paradoxically, data is the most under-valued and de-glamorised aspect of AI. In this paper, we report on data practices in high-stakes AI, from interviews with 53 AI practitioners in India, East and West African countries, and USA. We define, identify, and present empirical evidence on Data Cascades—compounding events causing negative, downstream effects from data issues—triggered by conventional AI/ML practices that undervalue data quality. Data cascades are pervasive (92% prevalence), invisible, delayed, but often avoidable. We discuss HCI opportunities in designing and incentivizing data excellence as a first-class citizen of AI, resulting in safer and more robust systems for all.},

abstract = {Load forecasting in short term is very important to economic dispatch and safety assessment of power system. Although existing load forecasting in short-term algorithms have reached required forecast accuracy, most of the forecasting models are black boxes and cannot be constructed to display mathematical models. At the same time, because of the abnormal load caused by the failure of the load data collection device, time synchronization, and malicious tampering, the accuracy of the existing load forecasting models is greatly reduced. To address these problems, this article proposes a Short-Term Load Forecasting algorithm by using Improved Gene Expression Programming and Abnormal Load Recognition (STLF-IGEP_ALR). First, the Recognition algorithm of Abnormal Load based on Probability Distribution and Cross Validation is proposed. By analyzing the probability distribution of rows and columns in load data, and using the probability distribution of rows and columns for cross-validation, misjudgment of normal load in abnormal load data can be better solved. Second, by designing strategies for adaptive generation of population parameters, individual evolution of populations and dynamic adjustment of genetic operation probability, an Improved Gene Expression Programming based on Evolutionary Parameter Optimization is proposed. Finally, the experimental results on two real load datasets and one open load dataset show that compared with the existing abnormal data detection algorithms, the algorithm proposed in this article have higher advantages in missing detection rate, false detection rate and precision rate, and STLF-IGEP_ALR is superior to other short-term load forecasting algorithms in terms of the convergence speed, MAE, MAPE, RSME, and R2.},

abstract = {Scalability, standardization, and management are important issues when working with very large Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). VGI is a rich and valuable source of Points of Interest (POI) information, but its inherent heterogeneity in content, structure, and scale across sources present major challenges for interlinking data sources for analysis. To be useful at scale, the raw information needs to be transformed into a standardized schema that can be easily and reliably used by data analysts. In this work, we tackle the problem of unifying POI categories (e.g. restaurants, temple, and hotel) across multiple data sources to aid in improving land use maps and population distribution estimation as well as support data analysts wishing to fuse multiple data sources with the OpenStreetMap (OSM) mapping platform or working with projects that are already configured in the OSM schema and wish to add additional sources of information. Graph theory and its implementation through the SONET graph database, provides a programmatic way to organize, store, and retrieve standardized POI categories at multiple levels of abstraction. Additionally, it addresses category heterogeneity across data sources by standardizing and managing categories in a way that makes cross-domain analysis possible.},

abstract = {The field of Predictive Analytics (PA) provides the possibility to utilize large amounts of data to improve forecasting, data-driven decision-making, and competitive advantage. Especially the transport logistics sector, which is characterized by high business-related uncertainties, time-sensitivity, and volatility, highly benefits from accurate resource and production planning. While success factors and framework conditions of applying PA are well-investigated on a theoretical SCM level, findings on internal and external challenges of transport logistics organizations remain scarce. Therefore, based on a multiple case approach, this study offers in-depth insights into six real-world cases of freight forwarders, ocean carriers, and air carriers. The results uncover both internal and external challenges. From the internal perspective, the biggest challenges are related to the technical implementation including the acquisition of globally generated, internal and external data and its harmonization. In addition, stakeholder management and target setting impede the development of PA. Regarding external challenges, relational and external conditions hamper the application. Therefore, especially actions of third-party institutions in terms of standardization and security enhancements are required. This study contributes to the existing literature in various ways as the systematic identification addresses real-world issues of PA in the neglected but crucial area of transport logistics, discussing urgent research needs and highlighting potential solutions. Additionally, the results offer valuable guidance for managers when implementing PA in transport logistics.},

abstract = {A number of natural language processing and text-mining algorithms have been developed to extract the geospatial cues (e.g., place names) to infer locations of content creators from publicly available information, such as text content, online social profiles, and the behaviors or interactions of users from social networks. These studies, however, can only successfully infer user locations at city levels with relatively decent accuracy, while much higher resolution is required for meaningful spatiotemporal analysis in geospatial fields. Additionally, geographical cues exploited by current text-based approaches are hidden in the unreliable, unstructured, informal, ungrammatical, and multilingual data, and therefore are hard to extract and make meaningful correctly. Instead of using such hidden geographic cues, this paper develops a GIS approach that can infer the true origin of tweets down to the zip code level by using and mining spatial (geo-tags) and temporal (timestamps when a message was posted) information recorded on user digital footprints. Further, individual major daily activity zones and mobility can be successfully inferred and predicted. By integrating GIS data and spatiotemporal clustering methods, this proposed approach can infer individual daily physical activity zones with spatial resolution as high as 20 m by 20 m or even higher depending on the number of digit footprints collected for social media users. The research results with detailed spatial resolution are necessary and useful for various applications such as human mobility pattern analysis, business site selection, disease control, or transportation systems improvement.},

abstract = {Detecting and repairing dirty data is one of the perennial challenges in data analytics, and failure to do so can result in inaccurate analytics and unreliable decisions. Over the past few years, there has been a surge of interest from both industry and academia on data cleaning problems including new abstractions, interfaces, approaches for scalability, and statistical techniques. To better understand the new advances in the field, we will first present a taxonomy of the data cleaning literature in which we highlight the recent interest in techniques that use constraints, rules, or patterns to detect errors, which we call qualitative data cleaning. We will describe the state-of-the-art techniques and also highlight their limitations with a series of illustrative examples. While traditionally such approaches are distinct from quantitative approaches such as outlier detection, we also discuss recent work that casts such approaches into a statistical estimation framework including: using Machine Learning to improve the efficiency and accuracy of data cleaning and considering the effects of data cleaning on statistical analysis.},

abstract = {A large number of published datasets (or sources) that follow Linked Data principles is currently available and this number grows rapidly. However, the major target of Linked Data, i.e., linking and integration, is not easy to achieve. In general, information integration is difficult, because (a) datasets are produced, kept, or managed by different organizations using different models, schemas, or formats, (b) the same real-world entities or relationships are referred with different URIs or names and in different natural languages,&lt;?brk?&gt;(c) datasets usually contain complementary information, (d) datasets can contain data that are erroneous, out-of-date, or conflicting, (e) datasets even about the same domain may follow different conceptualizations of the domain, (f) everything can change (e.g., schemas, data) as time passes. This article surveys the work that has been done in the area of Linked Data integration, it identifies the main actors and use cases, it analyzes and factorizes the integration process according to various dimensions, and it discusses the methods that are used in each step. Emphasis is given on methods that can be used for integrating several datasets. Based on this analysis, the article concludes with directions that are worth further research.},

Modern design tools and material databases should be more scalable, reliable, and accessible to take full advantage of the quantity of available building data. New approaches providing well-structured information can lead to robust decision support for architectural simulations earlier in the design process; rule-based decision engines and knowledge bases are the link between current data and useful decision frameworks. Integrating distributed API-based systems means that material data silos existing in modern tools can become enriched and extensible for future use with additional data from building documents, other databases, and the minds of design professionals.

abstract = {The e-commerce era is witnessing a rapid increase of mobile Internet users. Major e-commerce companies nowadays see billions of mobile accesses every day. Hidden in these records are valuable user behavioral characteristics such as their shopping preferences and browsing patterns. And, to extract these knowledge from the huge dataset, we need to first link records to the corresponding mobile devices. This Mobile Access Records Resolution (MARR) problem is confronted with two major challenges: (1) device identifiers and other attributes in access records might be missing or unreliable; (2) the dataset contains billions of access records from millions of devices. To the best of our knowledge, as a novel challenge industrial problem of mobile Internet, no existing method has been developed to resolve entities using mobile device identifiers in such a massive scale. To address these issues, we propose a SParse Identifier-linkage Graph (SPI-Graph) accompanied with the abundant mobile device profiling data to accurately match mobile access records to devices. Furthermore, two versions (unsupervised and semi-supervised) of Parallel Graph-based Record Resolution (PGRR) algorithm are developed to effectively exploit the advantages of the large-scale server clusters comprising of more than 1,000 computing nodes. We empirically show superior performances of PGRR algorithms in a very challenging and sparse real data set containing 5.28 million nodes and 31.06 million edges from 2.15 billion access records compared to other state-of-the-arts methodologies.},

abstract = {Data, and its collection, is one core aspect of technology and research, nowadays. Various scientific disciplines are interested in collecting human data in practically any context (at home, at work, during leisure time). For example, experts from the field of Psychology design studies for reliable and valid data collection in the laboratory and in the wild. We propose a generic platform for data-collection software development to be used by scientists without a programming background. This is done by adapting a basic Unity project through a configuration file provided by the platform users through an easy to use user interface. The scientific user can adapt and rearrange pre-defined data collection modules targeting a desired research question, implement it as application within the data collection platform and use and manage the application for data collection and later data analysis. As a proof of concept, the platform was embedded with build-in application modules for wide-spread Psychology data collection experiments. The versatility of the platform was tested by creating three diverse prototypical applications. Finally, the usability of the proposed platform evaluated using the System Usability Scale obtained high usability results. The robust module-based nature of the platform architecture makes is possible to create a various range of of psychologically-proven applications with different features to be decided by the researcher. This holds true for both the development phase of the applications, as well as, for after deployment.},

In this context, questions of personal data privacy, security, access, control and (dis-)empowerment are critical considerations for system designers and policy makers alike. To explore the family perspective on this landscape of what we call Family Civic Data, we carried out ethnographic interviews with four North-East families. Our design-game-based interviews were effective for engaging both adults and children to talk about the impact of this dry, technical topic on their lives. Our findings, delivered in the form of design guidelines, show support for dynamic consent: families would feel most empowered if involved in an ongoing co-operative relationship with state welfare and civic authorities through shared interaction with their data.},

Gut feeling is no longer sufficient in decision making, but intuition has to be combined with support from the huge amount of data available today. Even if the amount of data is enormous, the quality of the data is not always good. Problems arise in at least two situations: i) the data is imprecise by nature and ii) the data is incomplete (or there are missing parts in the data set). Both situations are problematic and need to be addressed appropriately. If these problems are solved, applications are to be found in various interesting fields.

We also developed a concatenation structure to allow the handling of company name changes, mergers, and spin-offs without artificially altering numerical series. At the same time, we maintained the transparency of the historical information on each individual company listed. Thanks to the overlapping of digital and hand-collected data, the completed database has a very high level of detail and accuracy. The dataset is particularly suited for any empirical research in financial economics and for more practically oriented numerical applications and forecasting simulations.},

abstract = {The growing number of different models and approaches for Geographic Information Systems (GIS) brings high complexity when we want to develop new approaches and compare a new GIS algorithm. In order to test and compare different processing models and approaches, in a simple way, we identified the need of defining uniform testing methods, able to compare processing algorithms in terms of performance and accuracy regarding large image processing, algorithms for GIS pattern-detection.Taking into account, for instance, images collected during a done flight or a satellite, it is important to know the processing cost to extract data when applying different processing models and approaches, as well as their accuracy (compare execution time vs. extracted data quality). In this work, we propose a GIS Benchmark (GPII), a benchmark that allows evaluating different approaches to detect/extract selected features from a GIS dataset. Considering a given dataset (or two data-sets, from different years, of the same region), it provides linear methods to compare different performance parameters regarding GIS information, making possible to access the most relevant information in terms of features and processing efficiency. Moreover, our approach to test algorithms makes possible to change the data-set in order to support different purpose algorithms.},

abstract = {With recent advances in mobile and sensor technologies, a large amount of efforts have been made on developing intelligent applications for taxi drivers, which provide beneficial guide and opportunity to improve the profit and work efficiency. However, limited scopes focus on the latent social interaction within cab drivers, and corresponding social propagation scheme to share driving behaviors has been largely ignored. To that end, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive study to reveal how the social propagation affects for better prediction of cab drivers' future behaviors. To be specific, we first investigate the correlation between drivers' skills and their mutual interactions in the latent vehicle-to-vehicle network, which intuitively indicates the effects of social influences. Along this line, by leveraging the classic social influence theory, we develop a two-stage framework for quantitatively revealing the latent driving pattern propagation within taxi drivers. Comprehensive experiments on a real-word data set collected from the New York City clearly validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on predicting future taxi driving behaviors, which also support the hypothesis that social factors indeed improve the predictability of driving behaviors.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT), in general, is a compelling paradigm that aims to connect everyday objects to the Internet. Nowadays, IoT is considered as one of the main technologies which contribute towards reshaping our daily lives in the next decade. IoT unlocks many exciting new opportunities in a variety of applications in research and industry domains. However, many have complained about the absence of the real-world IoT data. Unsurprisingly, a common question that arises regularly nowadays is "Does the IoT already exist?". So far, little has been known about the real-world situation on IoT, its attributes, the presentation of data, and user interests. To answer this question, in this work, we conduct an in-depth analytical investigation on real IoT data. More specifically, we identify IoT data sources over the Web and develop a crawler engine to collect large-scale real-world IoT data for the first time. We make the results of our work available to the public in order to assist the community in the future research. In particular, we collect the data of nearly two million Internet connected objects and study trends in IoT using a real-world query set from an IoT search engine. Based on the collected data and our analysis, we identify the typical characteristics of IoT data. The most intriguing finding of our study is that IoT data is mainly disseminated using Web Mapping while the emerging IoT solutions such as the Web of Things are currently not well adopted. On top of our findings, we further discuss future challenges and open research problems in the IoT area.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in information technology have ushered a new wave of systems integrating Internet technology with sensing, wireless communication, and computational resources over existing infrastructures. As a result, myriad complex, non-traditional Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have emerged, characterized by interaction among people, physical facilities, and embedded sensors and computers, all generating vast amounts of complex data. Such a case is encountered within a contemporary airport hall setting: passengers roaming, information systems governing various functions, and data being generated and processed by cameras, phones, sensors, and other Internet of Things technology. This setting has considerable potential of contributing to goals entertained by the CPS operators, such as airlines, airport operators/owners, technicians, users, and more. We model the airport setting as an instance of such a complex, data-intensive CPS where multiple actors and data sources interact, and generalize a methodology to support it and other similar systems. Furthermore, this article instantiates the methodology and pipeline for predictive analytics for passenger flow, as a characteristic manifestation of such systems requiring a tailored approach. Our methodology also draws from DataOps principles, using multi-modal and real-life data to predict the underlying distribution of the passenger flow on a flight-level basis (improving existing day-level predictions), anticipating when and how the passengers enter the airport and move through the check-in and baggage drop-off process. This allows to plan airport resources more efficiently while improving customer experience by avoiding passenger clumping at check-in and security. We demonstrate results obtained over a case from a major international airport in the Netherlands, improving up to 60% upon predictions of daily passenger flow currently in place.},

abstract = {Logs are widely used by large and complex software-intensive systems for troubleshooting. There have been a lot of studies on log-based anomaly detection. To detect the anomalies, the existing methods mainly construct a detection model using log event data extracted from historical logs. However, we find that the existing methods do not work well in practice. These methods have the close-world assumption, which assumes that the log data is stable over time and the set of distinct log events is known. However, our empirical study shows that in practice, log data often contains previously unseen log events or log sequences. The instability of log data comes from two sources: 1) the evolution of logging statements, and 2) the processing noise in log data. In this paper, we propose a new log-based anomaly detection approach, called LogRobust. LogRobust extracts semantic information of log events and represents them as semantic vectors. It then detects anomalies by utilizing an attention-based Bi-LSTM model, which has the ability to capture the contextual information in the log sequences and automatically learn the importance of different log events. In this way, LogRobust is able to identify and handle unstable log events and sequences. We have evaluated LogRobust using logs collected from the Hadoop system and an actual online service system of Microsoft. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can well address the problem of log instability and achieve accurate and robust results on real-world, ever-changing log data.},

abstract = {Real-time and reliable traffic flow estimation is the basis of urban traffic management and control. However, the existing research focuses on how to use the historical data of surveillance intersection to predict future traffic conditions. As we know, there are few effective algorithms to infer the real-time traffic state of non-surveillance intersections from limited road surveillance by using traffic information in the urban road system. In this paper, we introduce a new solution to solve the prediction task of traffic flow analysis by using traffic data, especially taxi historical data, traffic network data and intersection historical data. The proposed solution takes advantage of GCN and CGAN, and we improved the Unet to realize an important part of the generator. Then, we capture the relationship between the intersections with surveillance and the intersections without surveillance by floating taxi-cabs covered in the whole city. The framework of CGAN can adjust the weights and enhance the inference ability to generate complete traffic status under current conditions. The experimental results show that our method is superior to other methods on the accuracy of traffic volume inference.},

abstract = {Cloud log forensics (CLF) mitigates the investigation process by identifying the malicious behavior of attackers through profound cloud log analysis. However, the accessibility attributes of cloud logs obstruct accomplishment of the goal to investigate cloud logs for various susceptibilities. Accessibility involves the issues of cloud log access, selection of proper cloud log file, cloud log data integrity, and trustworthiness of cloud logs. Therefore, forensic investigators of cloud log files are dependent on cloud service providers (CSPs) to get access of different cloud logs. Accessing cloud logs from outside the cloud without depending on the CSP is a challenging research area, whereas the increase in cloud attacks has increased the need for CLF to investigate the malicious activities of attackers. This paper reviews the state of the art of CLF and highlights different challenges and issues involved in investigating cloud log data. The logging mode, the importance of CLF, and cloud log-as-a-service are introduced. Moreover, case studies related to CLF are explained to highlight the practical implementation of cloud log investigation for analyzing malicious behaviors. The CLF security requirements, vulnerability points, and challenges are identified to tolerate different cloud log susceptibilities. We identify and introduce challenges and future directions to highlight open research areas of CLF for motivating investigators, academicians, and researchers to investigate them.},

abstract = {Scientific data publications may include interactive data applications designed by scientists to explore a scientific problem. Defined as knowledge systems, their development is complex when data are aggregated from multiple sources over time. Multimodal data are created, encoded, and maintained differently, and even when reporting about identical phenomena, fields and their values may be inconsistent across datasets. To assure the validity and accuracy of the application, the data has to abide by curation requirements similar to those ruling digital libraries. We present a novel, inquiry-driven curation approach aimed to optimize multimodal datasets curation and maximize data reuse by domain researchers. We demonstrate the method through the ASTRIAGraph project, in which multiple data sources about near earth space objects are aggregated into a central knowledge system. The process involves multidisciplinary collaboration, resulting in the design of a data model as the backbone for both data curation and scientific inquiry. We demonstrate a) how data provenance information is needed to assess the uncertainty of the results of scientific inquiries involving multiple data sources, and b) that continuous curation of integrated datasets is facilitated when undertaken as integral to the research project. The approach provides flexibility to support expansion of scientific inquiries and data in the knowledge system, and allows for transparent and explainable results.},

Good quality and proper publishing of OGD enable (apart from the control function) their business use. This affects the economic benefits. The author has identified the main problems of data publication based on Central Repositories for Public Information (CRPI) in Poland, the USA, the UK and Germany. The article focuses on the maturity of data formats, automated processing with Application Programming Interface (API), using the concept of Linked Open Data (LOD). The aim of the article is to identify barriers to the implementation of OGD-based solutions and to indicate recommendations to overcome these barriers. The research shows that the methods of sharing OGD differ significantly between countries despite common guidelines. The main problem is the use of unstructured data, unsuitable for the use of LOD.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The promise of technology-enabled, data-intensive scholarship is predicated upon access to knowledge infrastructures that are not yet in place. Scientific data management requires expertise in the scientific domain and in organizing and retrieving complex research objects. The Knowledge Infrastructures project compares data management activities of four large, distributed, multidisciplinary scientific endeavors as they ramp their activities up or down; two are big science and two are small science. Research questions address digital library solutions, knowledge infrastructure concerns, issues specific to individual domains, and common problems across domains. Findings are based on interviews (n=113 to date), ethnography, and other analyses of these four cases, studied since 2002. Based on initial comparisons, we conclude that the roles of digital libraries in scientific data management often depend upon the scale of data, the scientific goals, and the temporal scale of the research projects being supported. Digital libraries serve immediate data management purposes in some projects and long-term stewardship in others. In small science projects, data management tools are selected, designed, and used by the same individuals. In the multi-decade time scale of some big science research, data management technologies, policies, and practices are designed for anticipated future uses and users. The need for library, archival, and digital library expertise is apparent throughout all four of these cases. Managing research data is a knowledge infrastructure problem beyond the scope of individual researchers or projects. The real challenges lie in designing digital libraries to assist in the capture, management, interpretation, use, reuse, and stewardship of research data.},

Error detection techniques can either be quantitative or qualitative; and error repairing is performed by applying data transformation scripts or by involving human experts, and sometimes both.In this tutorial, we discuss the main facets and directions in designing qualitative data cleaning techniques. We present a taxonomy of current qualitative error detection techniques, as well as a taxonomy of current data repairing techniques. We will also discuss proposals for tackling the challenges for cleaning "big data" in terms of scale and distribution.},

And a large number of false tests will occur to the real data. To solve this problem, a networks model detection method for super-resolution reconstruction of DeepFake video is proposed. First of all, the face area of real data is processed by Gaussian blur, which is converted into negative data, and the real data and processing data are input into neural network for training. Then the residual network is used for super-resolution reconstruction of test data. Finally, the trained model is used to test the video after super-resolution reconstruction. Experiments show that the proposed method can reduce the false detection rate and improve the accuracy in detection of single frames.},

This practice, termed post-selection inference in the statistical literature, may negatively affect both point estimation and uncertainty quantification, and therefore hinder trustworthy decision making in A/B testing. To address this issue, in this paper we explore two seemingly unrelated paths, one based on supervised machine learning and the other on empirical Bayes, and propose post-selection inferential approaches that combine the strengths of both. Through large-scale simulated and empirical examples, we demonstrate that our proposed methodologies stand out among other existing ones in both reducing post-selection biases and improving confidence interval coverage rates, and discuss how they can be conveniently adjusted to real-life scenarios.},

One of the main concerns in IoT is how to provide trustworthy data. The data validation network ensures that the generated data by data sources in the IoT are trustworthy. However, the existing data validation network depends on a centralized entity for the selection of data validators. In this paper, a decentralized validator selection model is proposed. The proposed model creates multiple clusters using the distributed hash table (DHT) technique. The selection process of data validators from different clusters in the model is done randomly in a decentralized scheme. It provides a global method of assignment, selection, and verification of the selected validators in the network.},

abstract = {Developing countries are increasingly taking advantage of the rapid advancement in ICT to replace paper-based operations with Information Management Systems (IMS) such as District Health Information Software (DHIS). While the adoption of IMS presents significant benefits, challenges exist in the quality of IMS data. Inaccurate, incomplete or redundant data in IMS has misled organisations into making incorrect decisions leading to customer dissatisfaction and high cost implications. There is an urgent need for IMS stakeholders to have mechanisms of assessing the quality of data prior to data analysis, data sharing or decision making. Data Accuracy Assessment Tool (DAAT) assesses and identifies errors in a pair of context related datasets. DAAT provides ability for Data Managers to easily compare datasets by choosing attributes of their interest from a pool of diverse attributes that define the data. Through reports and visualization, the tool reveals the accuracy of data in real time using metrics such as validity, completeness and duplication of data. DAAT is scalable since it can be integrated with any IMS such as DHIS. The tool has been tested using four years Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) program data from JHPIEGO's AIDSFree project in Tanzania.},

Similarity search and similarity join are two important operations to address the poor data quality problem. Although many similarity search and join algorithms have been proposed, they did not utilize the abilities of modern hardware with multi-core processors. It calls for new parallel algorithms to enable multi-core processors to meet the high performance requirement of similarity search and join on big data. To this end, in this paper we propose parallel algorithms to support efficient similarity search and join with edit-distance constraints. We adopt the partition-based framework and extend it to support parallel similarity search and join on multi-core processors. We also develop two novel pruning techniques. We have implemented our algorithms and the experimental results on two real datasets show that our parallel algorithms achieve high performance and obtain good speedup.},

The parallel data processing framework based on MapReduce can deal with the challenge brought by big data. However, there exist two important issues, avoiding redundant pairs led by the multi-pass blocking method and optimizing candidate pairs based on the transitive relations of similarity. In this paper, we propose a multi-signature based parallel entity resolution method, called multi-sig-er, which supports unstructured data and structured data. Two redundancy elimination strategies are adopted to prune the candidate pairs and reduce the number of similarity computation without affecting the resolution accuracy. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our method tends to handle large datasets and it is more suitable for complex similarity computation than simple object matching.},

abstract = {Geospatial data providers have adopted a variety of science gateways as the primary method for accessing remote geospatial data. Early systems provided little more than a simple file transfer mechanism but over the past decade, advanced features were incorporated to allow users to retrieve data seamlessly without concern for native file formats, data resolution, or even spatial projections. However, the recent growth in Deep Learning models in the geospatial domains has exposed additional requirements for accessing geospatial repositories. In this paper we discussed the major data accessibility challenges faced by the Deep Learning community namely: (1) reproducibility of data preprocessing workflows, (2) optimizing data transfer between gateways and computational environments, and (3) minimizing local storage requirements using on-the-fly augmentation. In this paper, we present our vision of spatial data generators to act as middleware between geospatial data gateways and Deep Learning models. We propose advanced features for spatial data generators and describe how they could satisfy the data accessibility requirements of the geospatial Deep Learning community. Lastly, we argue that satisfying these data accessibility requirements will not only enhance the reproducibility of Deep Learning workflows and speed their development but will also improve the quality of training and prediction of operational Deep Learning models.},

Due to their very large volumes, their nature of streaming, their highly variable levels of data quality, as well as many possible links with other types of data, making sense of spatial trajectory data becomes one of the crucial areas for big data analytics.

Open data is released openly by governments to achieve various objectives, such as transparency, informing citizen engagement, or supporting private enterprise. Critical examination of ongoing social changes, including the post-truth phenomenon, suggests the quality, integrity, and authenticity of open data may be at risk. We introduce this risk through various lenses, describe some of the types of risk we expect using a threat model approach, identify approaches to mitigate each risk, and present real-world examples of cases where the risk has already caused harm. As an initial assessment of awareness of this disinformation risk, we compare our analysis to perspectives captured during open data stakeholder consultations in Canada.},

Although we can identify movements that are relatively independent of each other today, we believe they will in all cases expand from their current margins to encompass larger domains and increasingly overlap.

abstract = {Software 2.0 refers to the fundamental shift in software engineering where using machine learning becomes the new norm in software with the availability of big data and computing infrastructure. As a result, many software engineering practices need to be rethought from scratch where data becomes a first-class citizen, on par with code. It is well known that 80--90% of the time for machine learning development is spent on data preparation. Also, even the best machine learning algorithms cannot perform well without good data or at least handling biased and dirty data during model training. In this tutorial, we focus on data collection and quality challenges that frequently occur in deep learning applications. Compared to traditional machine learning, there is less need for feature engineering, but more need for significant amounts of data. We thus go through state-of-the-art data collection techniques for machine learning. Then, we cover data validation and cleaning techniques for improving data quality.

abstract = {In the era of big data, privacy becomes a challenging issue which already attracts a good number of research efforts. In the literature, most of existing privacy preserving algorithms focus on protecting users' privacy from being disclosed by making the set of designated semi-id features indiscriminate. However, how to automatically determine the appropriate semi-id features from high-dimensional correlated data is seldom studied. Therefore, in this paper we first theoretically study the problem and propose the IPFS algorithm to find all possible features forming the candidate semi-id feature set which can infer users' privacy. Then, the KIPFS algorithm is proposed to find the key features from the candidate semi-id feature set. By anonymizing the key feature set, called as key inferring privacy features (KIPFS), users' privacy is protected. To evaluate the effectiveness and the efficacy of the proposed approach, two state-of-the-art algorithms, i.e., K-anonymity and t-closeness, applied on the designated semi-id feature set are chose as the baseline algorithms and their revised versions are applied on the KIPFS for the performance comparison. The promising results showed that by anonymizing the identified KIPFS, both aforementioned algorithms can achieve better performance than the original ones in terms of efficiency and data quality.},

abstract = {Big data is recognized as one of the three technology trends at the leading edge a CEO cannot afford to overlook in 2012. Big data is characterized by volume, velocity, variety and veracity ("data in doubt"). As big data applications, many of the emerging event processing applications must process events that arrive from sources such as sensors and social media, which have inherent uncertainties associated with them. Consider, for example, the possibility of incomplete data streams and streams including inaccurate data. In this tutorial we classify the different types of uncertainty found in event processing applications and discuss the implications on event representation and reasoning. An area of research in which uncertainty has been studied is Artificial Intelligence. We discuss, therefore, the main Artificial Intelligence-based event processing systems that support probabilistic reasoning. The presented approaches are illustrated using an example concerning crime detection.},

abstract = { A key challenge of big data analytics is how to collect a large volume of (labeled) data. Crowdsourcing aims to address this challenge via aggregating and estimating high-quality data (e.g., sentiment label for text) from pervasive clients/users. Existing studies on crowdsourcing focus on designing new methods to improve the aggregated data quality from unreliable/noisy clients. However, the security aspects of such crowdsourcing systems remain under-explored to date. We aim to bridge this gap in this work. Specifically, we show that crowdsourcing is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, in which malicious clients provide carefully crafted data to corrupt the aggregated data. We formulate our proposed data poisoning attacks as an optimization problem that maximizes the error of the aggregated data. Our evaluation results on one synthetic and two real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed attacks can substantially increase the estimation errors of the aggregated data. We also propose two defenses to reduce the impact of malicious clients. Our empirical results show that the proposed defenses can substantially reduce the estimation errors of the data poisoning attacks.},

Therefore, how to access the varied data sources of isomerism and heterogeneous data and how to process and analyze the data become the current challenges. In this paper, we design and implement a data aggregation and anomaly detection system for isomerism and heterogeneous data. The system proposes a novel isomerism and heterogeneous data access sub-system. The sub-system applies improved Avro as the unified data description format and presents different storage algorithms for data serialization to raise the data adaption efficiency. The system adopts Kafka as the message middleware for data aggregation and distribution. Also, we design the anomaly detection and alarming sub-system for detecting the anomalies of streaming data on time and notifying the users. The data aggregation and anomaly detection system has passed all the tests and applied in small and medium-sized enterprises.},

abstract = {Higher education institutions are at this stage, on the one hand, faced with challenges never seen before and, on the other hand, their action is moving very rapidly into digital learning spaces. These challenges are increasingly complex because of the global competition for resources, students and teachers. In addition, the amount of data produced inside and outside higher education institutions has grown exponentially, so more and more institutions are exploring the potential of Big Data to meet these challenges. In this context, higher education institutions and key stakeholders (students, teachers, and governance) can derive multiple benefits from learning analytics using different data analysis strategies to produce summative, real-time and predictive information and recommendations. However, it may be questioned whether institutions, academic administrative staff as well as including those with responsibility for governance, are prepared for learning analytics? As a response to the question raised in this paper is presented an extension of a disruptive conceptual approach to higher education, using information gathered by IoT and based on Big Data &amp; Cloud Computing and Learning Analytics analysis tools, with the main focus on the stakeholder governance.},

abstract = {Numeric inconsistencies are common in real-life knowledge bases and social networks. To catch such errors, we propose to extend graph functional dependencies with linear arithmetic expressions and comparison predicates, referred to as NGDs. We study fundamental problems for NGDs. We show that their satisfiability, implication and validation problems are Σ 2 p-complete, ¶II2 p-complete and coNP-complete, respectively. However, if we allow non-linear arithmetic expressions, even of degree at most 2, the satisfiability and implication problems become undecidable. In other words, NGDs strike a balance between expressivity and complexity.To make practical use of NGDs, we develop an incremental algorithm IncDect to detect errors in a graph G using NGDs, in response to updates Δ G to G. We show that the incremental validation problem is coNP-complete. Nonetheless, algorithm IncDect is localizable, i.e., its cost is determined by small neighbors of nodes in Δ G instead of the entire G. Moreover, we parallelize IncDect such that it guarantees to reduce running time with the increase of processors. Using real-life and synthetic graphs, we experimentally verify the scalability and efficiency of the algorithms.},

Recent advancements in the literature leverage human computing power known as crowdsourcing to manage and harness big data for various applications. However, human involvement in the completion of crowdsourcing tasks is an error-prone process that affects the overall performance of the crowd. Thus, controlling the quality of workers is an essential step for crowdsourcing systems, which due to unavailability of ground-truth data for any task at hand becomes increasingly challenging. To propose a solution to this problem, in this study, we propose OSQC (Online Statistical Quality Control Framework) for managing the performance of workers in crowdsourcing. OSQC ascertains the worker's performance by using a statistical model and then leverages the traditional statistical control techniques to decide whether to retain a worker for crowdsourcing or to evict him. We evaluate our proposed framework on a real dataset and demonstrate how OSQC assists crowdsourcing to maintain its accuracy.},

abstract = {Pattern matching is an important task in the field of Complex Event Processing (CEP). However, exact event pattern matching methods could suffer from low hit rate and loss for meaningful events identification due to the heterogeneous and dirty sources in the big data era. Since both events and patterns could be imprecise, the actual event trace may have different event names as well as structures from the pre-defined pattern. The low-quality data even intensifies the difficulty of matching. In this work, we propose to learn embedding representations for patterns and event traces separately and calculate their similarity as the scores for approximate matching.},

In their organizational trajectory towards a "culture of data," our informants perceived four values associated with BI: data-driven, predictive and proactive, shared accountability, and inquisitive. Each value corresponds to a mythology of big data and BI. For each, we highlight the ways in which the enactment of the mythology is problematized by disconnects between aggregate and drill-down views of data that often impede the desired actionability. Our findings contribute initial empirical evidence of the ways in which the epistemological biases of BI systems influence organizations. We suggest design implications for better enabling data-driven decision making.},

However, the complexity and multi-dimensionality of clinical data make medical scientists' progress slow, and comprehensive use of various big data technologies is needed to help improve the efficiency of clinical research. Visualization technology can display data in an intuitive and easy-to-read way, helping medical researchers understand data, while parallel computing can greatly improve computing efficiency. Therefore, this paper explores the application strategies of data analysis technology and visualization technology in the management and analysis of clinical research data, and builds a set of clinical research data management analysis system, which combines various technologies to help effectively promote medical clinical.},

abstract = {In conventional metamorphic testing, metamorphic relations (MRs) are identified as necessary properties of a computer program's intended functionality, whereby violations of MRs reveal faults in the program---under the assumption that the source and follow-up inputs (test cases used in metamorphic testing) are valid. In the present study, the authors argue that MRs can also be used to validate and assess the quality of the program's input data---under the assumption that the source or follow-up inputs can be inappropriately generated. Using this new perspective, a case study in the natural language processing domain is used to explore the different types of text messages that are difficult to interpret by (Chinese-English) machine translation. A total of 46,180 short user comments on Personal Tailor (a 2013 Chinese film), collected from Douban (a popular Chinese social media platform), has been used as the primary dataset of this study, and the analysis of results demonstrates that the proposed MR-based data validation method is useful for the automatic identification of poorly translated text messages.},

Each of these servers produces a stream of log data, recording for example every user it serves, along with each video stream they access, when they play and pause streams, and more. Each server also records network- and system-level data such as TCP connection statistics. In aggregate, the servers produce billions of lines of log data from over a thousand locations daily.},

Religious significance has been attached to an immense variety of artifacts and documents, often in written form, in nearly all spoken and written languages over the past millennia. The rise of the digital age gives to the scholar in religious studies the opportunity to build research over a much wider array of data than ever before; institutions which have data repositories (such as libraries, museums, universities, etc.) similarly have the chance to make their collections available to a larger community. On the other hand, however, there is a serious risk that a considerable amount of data gets lost during the "Digital transition". This paper presents the approach of the RESILIENCE Research Infrastructure in dealing with the issue of big data and data loss within the field of religious studies.},

It has wide applications in military surveillance for enemy activities, detection of potential terrorist attacks, credit card fraud detection, network intrusion, computer virus attack, clinical trials, severe weather prediction, athlete performance analysis, and many other data mining tasks. In today's big data age, multivariate data sets are very complex. Variables among different dimensions are usually correlated with different variations. Classical data mining methods with Euclidean distance measure are not working well for mining multivariate outliers. In this study, we propose a normal mixture model-based framework of multivariate outlier detection. We fit the model parameters through the robust EM algorithm. The K-means clustering algorithm is used to provide the initial inputs for the EM algorithm. The well-know Mahalanobis distance is used to determine the cutoff points for outlier detection via the chi-square distribution critical values. Implementation details of this framework are also discussed.},

Our approach comprises: (a) back-end pipelines that use AI to infer navigable data structures from streams of unstructured text, media and metadata; and (b) front-end representations of these structures grounded in the Visual Analytics literature. Through our creation of multiple end-to-end data applications, we learned that representing the varying quality of inferred data structures was crucial for making the use and limitations of AI transparent to users.

This revamped version of policy analysis continues the long-standing tradition of applying statistical modeling to better understand policy effects and decision making, but also incorporates other computational approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI) and computer simulation. Although much attention has been given to the development of capabilities for data analysis, there is much less attention to understanding the role of data management in a context of AI in government. In this paper, we argue that data management capabilities are foundational to data analysis of any kind, but even more important in the present AI context. This is so because without proper data management, simply acquiring data or systems will not produce desired outcomes. We also argue that realizing the potential of AI for social good relies on investments specifically focused on this social outcome, investments in the processes of building trust in government data, and ensuring the data are ready and suitable for use, for both immediate and future uses.},

This paper deals with the question how the model itself and its input can be effectively complemented. This takes into account the commonly known fact, that the accuracy of a model output depends on the model input. Therefore an approach for using techniques of Knowledge Discovery in Databases is introduced to derive logical relations from the data. We discuss how Knowledge Discovery would be applied, as a preprocessing step for simulation scenario setups, in order to provide benefits for the level of accuracy in simulation models.},
